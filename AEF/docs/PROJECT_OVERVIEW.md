# ü§ñ AEF: Agentic Execution Framework
## Universal Workflow Automation with Human Oversight

---

## üéØ Project Vision

The **Agentic Execution Framework (AEF)** is a revolutionary automation system that transforms recorded Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) into reliable, transparent, and human-supervised agentic execution workflows. Unlike traditional automation tools that require hardcoded logic for specific domains, AEF creates a **universal orchestration system** that can adapt to any business process through intelligent task decomposition, dynamic agent creation, and iterative learning from human feedback.

### Core Philosophy
- **Universal Adaptability**: Handle any workflow without domain-specific hardcoding
- **Human-Centric Control**: Complete transparency, steerability, and oversight
- **Iterative Intelligence**: Learn and improve from every execution
- **Trust Through Transparency**: Visual monitoring and audit trails for every action

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### **Three-Layer Architecture**

#### **1. Orchestrator Layer** - The Universal Project Manager
The central intelligence that:
- Analyzes any SOP and generates dynamic execution plans
- Decomposes workflows into optimal task structures
- Manages human feedback loops and intervention requests
- Accumulates workflow-specific context and learning
- Coordinates multiple sub-agents without predefined specializations

#### **2. Dynamic Agent Layer** - Generic Task Executors
Dynamically spawned agents that:
- Execute specific tasks using browser-use + reasoning capabilities
- Operate without hardcoded domain knowledge
- Report confidence levels and escalate uncertainties
- Provide detailed execution evidence through visual monitoring
- Adapt to any task specification provided by the orchestrator

#### **3. Human Oversight Layer** - The Control Cockpit
Comprehensive interface providing:
- **Plan Review**: Visual hierarchical task breakdown before execution
- **Live Monitoring**: Real-time agent activity with screenshot timelines
- **Intervention Management**: Context-rich escalation handling
- **Learning Feedback**: Pattern recognition and preference capture
- **Complete Audit Trails**: Full transparency for compliance and debugging

## üéÆ User Experience Flow

### **Phase 1: Plan Generation & Human Review**
```
1. Human selects SOP from library ‚Üí Clicks "Execute"
2. Orchestrator analyzes SOP ‚Üí Generates hierarchical execution plan
3. Beautiful visualization shows:
   - Task breakdown and dependencies
   - Proposed agent assignments
   - Estimated confidence levels
   - Potential escalation points
4. Human reviews plan ‚Üí Provides feedback ‚Üí Approves/modifies
5. System finalizes plan ‚Üí Ready for execution
```

### **Phase 2: Execution with Intelligent Oversight**
```
1. Orchestrator spawns sub-agents ‚Üí Begins execution
2. Real-time cockpit shows:
   - Multi-agent timeline with screenshots
   - Agent reasoning and confidence scores
   - Live progress across all tasks
3. When uncertainty/errors occur:
   - Sub-agent reports to orchestrator (90%+ confidence threshold)
   - Orchestrator attempts resolution
   - If unresolvable ‚Üí Escalates to human with full context
4. Human provides guidance ‚Üí System learns ‚Üí Execution continues
```

### **Phase 3: Learning & Continuous Improvement**
```
1. Every human intervention ‚Üí Stored in workflow-specific context
2. Successful patterns ‚Üí Applied to future runs
3. Confidence calibration ‚Üí Improved over time
4. Next execution ‚Üí Fewer interventions needed
```

## üß† Context Learning & Intelligence System

### **Hierarchical Context Storage**
- **Workflow-Specific**: Patterns unique to individual SOPs
- **Pattern-Based**: Similar task patterns across different workflows  
- **Global**: System-wide learned behaviors and error handling

### **Learning Categories**
1. **Classification Decisions**: "First Round Capital" ‚Üí Investor (not customer)
2. **Error Handling**: Gmail rate limit ‚Üí Wait 15 minutes, retry with exponential backoff
3. **Human Preferences**: "Always chunk large email batches into groups of 50"
4. **Confidence Calibration**: When agent reports 85% confidence, actual success rate is 92%
5. **Successful Strategies**: Effective task decomposition patterns that worked

### **Context Application Strategy**
- Pre-execution context review and pattern application
- Novel situation detection and appropriate escalation
- Continuous confidence threshold adjustment based on performance
- Suggestion system for workflow improvements based on accumulated learning

## üé® Visual Monitoring & Transparency

### **Enhanced Timeline System**
Building on existing visual monitoring capabilities:
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Separate timeline lanes for each active agent
- **Action Annotations**: Visual overlays showing exactly what agents clicked/typed
- **Reasoning Display**: Agent internal thought processes at each decision point
- **Confidence Visualization**: Color-coded confidence levels throughout execution
- **Interactive Debugging**: Click any timeline point for full context inspection

### **Cockpit Dashboard Features**
- **Live Execution View**: Real-time agent activities with screenshot streams
- **Plan Visualization**: Beautiful hierarchical task breakdown with progress indicators
- **Intervention Queue**: Priority-sorted human requests with rich context
- **Performance Analytics**: Success rates, timing patterns, learning progress
- **Audit Export**: Complete evidence packages for compliance and analysis

## üîß Technical Implementation Strategy

### **Dynamic Agent Creation**
```python
class GenericAgent:
    def __init__(self, task_specification: dict, workflow_context: dict):
        self.task = task_specification
        self.context = workflow_context
        self.confidence_threshold = 0.90  # High standard for autonomous action
        self.browser_session = None
        
    async def execute_task(self):
        # Generic task execution using browser-use + reasoning
        # No hardcoded domain knowledge - pure intelligence-based
```

### **Orchestrator Intelligence**
- **SOP Analysis**: Parse any workflow structure and identify logical boundaries
- **Task Decomposition**: Dynamic chunking based on complexity and human preferences
- **Agent Allocation**: Optimal sub-agent assignment with load balancing
- **Error Recovery**: Multi-level recovery strategies (agent ‚Üí orchestrator ‚Üí human)
- **Learning Integration**: Apply accumulated context to improve future executions

### **Human-AI Communication Protocol**
```python
class EscalationRequest:
    context: dict           # Full situation context with screenshots
    confidence_gap: float   # How far below threshold
    suggested_actions: list # Orchestrator's proposed solutions
    urgency_level: str      # High/Medium/Low based on workflow criticality
    learning_opportunity: bool  # Whether this could improve future runs
```
