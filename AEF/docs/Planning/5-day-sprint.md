# 5-Day Sprint: Maximum Reliability Push

## Success Criteria for the Week

**Primary Goal**: Achieve 90% success rate on 1-2 well-defined workflows
**Secondary Goal**: Build a foundation that can scale to more workflows next week

**Success Metrics**:
- 90% task completion rate on eval suite
- <5% catastrophic failures (completely wrong actions)
- Measurable improvement day-over-day
- Clear understanding of remaining failure modes

**Failure Criteria**:
- Still at <70% success rate by Friday
- No reliable measurement system in place
- Major architectural decisions still unclear

## 5-Day Sprint Plan

### Day 1: Evaluation Foundation
**Goal**: Build measurement capability before optimizing anything

**Morning**: 
- Define 2 specific workflows for evaluation (suggest: Gmailâ†’CRM workflow + 1 simpler one)
- Create detailed success criteria for each step
- Build basic eval harness that can run workflows and score them

**Afternoon**:
- Run baseline tests with current browser-use setup
- Document all failure modes and categorize them
- Establish daily eval routine (run tests, measure, log results)

**Output**: Working eval pipeline + baseline performance numbers

### Days 2-5: Reliability Improvement Areas

The following improvement areas should be explored and implemented based on eval data and impact potential:

#### High Priority Improvements
- **Agent Architecture**: Implement planner-executor separation for better task decomposition and reasoning
- **Memory & Context Management**: Add scratchpad functionality, cross-step memory, and workflow-specific learnings
- **Prompt Engineering**: Optimize system prompts for better reasoning, error handling, and task understanding
- **Basic Human Cockpit**: Build simple interface to observe test runs, see agent reasoning, and track progress

#### Core Reliability Improvements  
- **LLM Selection**: Test different models (GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet, Gemini 2.0 Flash) on eval suite
- **Error Handling & Recovery**: Implement retry logic, validation checks, and graceful degradation
- **Uncertainty Handling**: Add confidence scoring and appropriate escalation mechanisms
- **Task Decomposition**: Optimize workflow breakdown based on eval learnings

#### Supporting Improvements
- **Execution Control & Timing**: Fine-tune execution speed and timing sensitivity
- **Context Prioritization**: Optimize what information the agent considers most important
- **Output Validation**: Strengthen verification of task completion

## Key Principles for the Sprint

1. **Measure Everything**: Run evals multiple times per day, track all changes
2. **Focus on High-Impact Variables**: Architecture, memory, prompts, error handling
3. **Iterate Fast**: Small changes, quick tests, rapid feedback loops
4. **Document Learnings**: What works, what doesn't, why
5. **Stay Pragmatic**: Use existing tools (browser-use) rather than building from scratch

## Risk Mitigation

**If behind schedule**: 
- Focus on highest-impact improvements first (Architecture + Memory + Prompts)
- Reduce to 1 workflow if 2 proves too ambitious
- Use simpler implementations if complex ones take too long

**If ahead of schedule**:
- Add third workflow to eval suite
- Experiment with more advanced architectural patterns
- Start building framework for next week's workflows

## Daily Success Checkpoints

**Day 1 Success**: Can run automated tests and have baseline numbers
**Day 2-3 Success**: Core improvements implemented, 40-50% improvement from baseline
**Day 4 Success**: Error handling robust, 80%+ success rate achieved
**Day 5 Success**: 90% success rate + documented architecture for scaling

## Variable Priority for Sprint

**Week 1 Focus** (from AEF-variables.md):
1. **Evaluation Framework** - Day 1 foundation
2. **Agent Architecture** - High priority improvement area
3. **Memory Management** - High priority improvement area  
4. **Prompt Engineering** - High priority improvement area
5. **Error Handling & Validation** - Core reliability improvement
6. **LLM Selection** - Core reliability improvement

**Deferred to Week 2**:
- Advanced Interaction Modality optimization
- Comprehensive Human Interface
- Security & Safety
- Advanced Learning & Adaptation
- Scalability & Performance

## Success Philosophy

This approach front-loads the measurement capability so you're never flying blind, then provides flexibility to tackle the highest-impact improvements based on what the eval data reveals. By Friday, you'll either have a 90% system or clear data on exactly what's preventing you from getting there.

The key is to maintain rapid iteration cycles with constant measurement, ensuring every change is validated against real performance data rather than intuition.
