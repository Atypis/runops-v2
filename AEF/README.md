# 🚀 AEF (Automated Execution Framework)

**Revolutionary SOP-to-Intelligence System**

Transform recorded workflows into intelligent, adaptive browser automation that thinks instead of blindly following steps.

## 🎯 **The Breakthrough**

Instead of brittle step-by-step automation that breaks when UIs change, AEF converts Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) into **intelligent task descriptions** that AI agents can reason through and adapt to real-world scenarios.

### **Traditional Approach** ❌
```
Step 1: Click element [47]
Step 2: Type "email@domain.com" 
Step 3: Click element [23]
❌ Breaks when UI changes
❌ No adaptation to errors
❌ No business logic understanding
```

### **AEF Intelligent Approach** ✅
```
GOAL: Process daily emails to identify investor communications
STRATEGY: Understand intent, adapt to UI changes, make smart decisions
✅ Handles authentication flows
✅ Adapts to UI changes automatically  
✅ Makes business decisions intelligently
✅ Processes complex workflows reliably
```

## 🏗️ **Architecture**

```
Recorded Workflow → SOP JSON → Intelligent Agent → Reliable Execution
```

### **Core Components**

1. **`IntelligentSOPExecutor`** - Converts rigid SOPs into intelligent task descriptions
2. **`SOPWorkflowManager`** - High-level workflow orchestration with security
3. **Browser-Use Integration** - Leverages existing AI browser automation
4. **Secure Credential Management** - Handles sensitive data without exposure

## 🚀 **Quick Start**

### **Prerequisites**
```bash
# Install dependencies (browser-use should be in parent directory)
pip install python-dotenv langchain-google-genai

# Set up environment
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-gemini-api-key"
```

### **Basic Usage**

```python
from AEF.agents.sop_to_agent import SOPWorkflowManager

# Set up credentials (AI never sees actual values)
sensitive_data = {
    'gmail_email': 'your-email@gmail.com',
    'gmail_password': 'your-password'
}

# Define allowed domains for security
allowed_domains = ['https://*.google.com', 'https://*.airtable.com']

# Create workflow manager
manager = SOPWorkflowManager(
    llm_model="gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20",
    sensitive_data=sensitive_data,
    allowed_domains=allowed_domains
)

# Execute workflow intelligently
result = await manager.execute_workflow("path/to/sop.json")
```

### **Run the Demo**

```bash
cd AEF
python3 test_intelligent_sop.py
```

Choose option 1 for full execution or option 2 for analysis only.

## 📊 **Early Promising Results**

Our Gmail → Airtable workflow test demonstrates the **potential** of the approach:

- ✅ **Intelligent Agent Creation** - Successfully converts SOPs to intelligent task descriptions
- ✅ **Secure Authentication** - Credentials properly protected during execution
- ✅ **Intent Understanding** - Agent demonstrates understanding of business logic
- ✅ **UI Adaptation** - Shows ability to work with real interfaces vs recorded selectors
- ⚠️ **Partial Execution** - Early stages work but full end-to-end reliability not yet achieved
- ⚠️ **Reliability Challenges** - Still significant work needed for consistent execution

**Current Status**: Proof of concept with promising early results, but **significant reliability improvements needed** for production use.

## 🔐 **Security Features**

- **Sensitive Data Protection**: AI sees placeholders, never actual credentials
- **Domain Restrictions**: Workflows limited to specified domains only
- **Secure Authentication**: Handles multi-step login flows safely
- **No Credential Logging**: Passwords never appear in logs or memory

## 🧠 **Intelligent Behaviors**

The AI agent demonstrates:

- **Adaptive UI Handling**: Continues when element indexes change
- **Authentication Intelligence**: Handles multi-step login flows
- **Business Logic Understanding**: Makes decisions about email categorization
- **Context Management**: Remembers processed items across tab switches
- **Error Recovery**: Gracefully handles page loads and timing issues
- **Structured Data Extraction**: Pulls relevant information from complex pages

## 🎯 **Key Innovation**

**The Magic**: Instead of recording "click button X, type Y", we extract the **business intent** and let AI agents reason through the execution:

```python
def _convert_sop_to_intelligent_task(self, sop_data):
    """
    Convert rigid SOP steps into intelligent task description.
    This is the key innovation - instead of following steps blindly,
    we give the AI the intent and let it reason through the execution.
    """
```

## 🔮 **Next Steps**

### **Immediate Priority: Reliability**
1. **End-to-End Execution** - Achieve consistent workflow completion
2. **Error Handling** - Robust recovery from common failure modes  
3. **Execution Monitoring** - Better visibility into agent decision-making
4. **Workflow Validation** - Ensure business outcomes are achieved correctly

### **Future Enhancements** (Once reliability is achieved)
- Enhanced memory systems for complex workflows
- Multi-agent coordination for enterprise workflows
- Real-time human feedback integration
- Cross-platform workflow execution
