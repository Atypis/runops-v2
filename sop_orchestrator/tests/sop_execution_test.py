EXECUTE THE FOLLOWING STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP):

**TITLE:** {sop_data['meta']['title']}
**GOAL:** {sop_data['meta']['goal']}
**PURPOSE:** {sop_data['meta']['purpose']}

**WORKFLOW STEPS TO EXECUTE:**

1. **Setup Applications**: Open Gmail and Airtable in separate browser tabs

2. **Process Daily Emails** (LOOP until all emails processed):
   a. Open the next unread email in Gmail
   b. Determine if this email is investor-related (look for VC firms, investment discussions, fundraising topics)
   c. If YES (investor-related):
      - Switch to Airtable tab
      - Search for the investor/fund in the CRM
      - If found: Update the existing record with new interaction details
      - If not found: Create a new investor record
      - Close any modals and switch back to Gmail
   d. If NO (not investor-related): Skip to next email
   e. Continue until all recent emails are processed

**IMPORTANT VARIABLES TO TRACK:**
- investor_name: Name of the investment fund or entity
- contact_person: Name of the primary contact person  
- contact_email: Email address of the contact
- stage: Current relationship stage (Contacted, Interested, etc.)
- last_interaction_date: Date of most recent interaction
- thread_summary_notes: Summary of the email thread
- follow_up_needed: Whether follow-up is required
- next_step_action: Description of next required action

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- All recent emails have been reviewed
- Investor-related emails have been logged in Airtable CRM
- Each investor record contains updated interaction information
- Workflow completes with summary of actions taken

**NOTE:** This is a demonstration/simulation. If you cannot access real Gmail/Airtable accounts, please simulate the workflow by:
1. Going to example websites that represent email/CRM interfaces
2. Demonstrating the decision-making process
3. Showing how you would extract and organize the required information
4. Explaining each step as you would perform it

Start by navigating to Gmail (gmail.com) or a demo email interface.
