# Memory System Status - RESOLVED ✅

## Current Status: WORKING

The memory system is now fully functional for both single-node and full-workflow executions. All memory artifacts contain rich data including DOM snapshots, action traces, browser state, and execution metadata.

## What Was Fixed

1. **Root Cause**: ExecutionEngine had early `return` statements that bypassed memory capture
2. **Architecture Discovery**: Two execution paths existed:
   - ExecutionEngine: Full memory capture (used for workflows)
   - HybridBrowserManager: Minimal memory (used for single nodes)
3. **Solution**: Modified `/api/aef/action/[id]` to use ExecutionEngine directly for single nodes

## Current Architecture

### Unified Execution Path
- **All executions** now go through ExecutionEngine
- **Single nodes**: `/api/aef/action/[executionId]` → ExecutionEngine.executeNodeById()
- **Full workflows**: `/api/aef/execute` → ExecutionEngine.executeWorkflow()

### Memory Artifacts Now Include
- Complete DOM snapshots (200+ chars of actual HTML)
- Full action traces with timestamps
- Browser state before/after each action
- Credential injection details
- LLM interactions
- Error handling and recovery
- Forwarding rules between nodes

### Cleaned Up Components
- **HybridBrowserManager**: Simplified to session management only, executeAction() marked deprecated
- **Removed**: `/api/aef/execute-nodes` route (unused)
- **Removed**: Duplicate memory capture logic in HybridBrowserManager
- **Removed**: Debug files and temporary scripts

## Memory Panel UI
The frontend memory panels now display rich data:
- **Inputs**: Environment state, credentials, variables, action inputs
- **Processing**: LLM interactions, browser events, action sequences
- **Outputs**: Results, state changes, extracted data, execution metadata

## Next Steps (Optional Future Improvements)
1. Rename HybridBrowserManager → BrowserSessionManager for clarity
2. Remove special-case `single-vnc-*` ID handling
3. Consolidate session management patterns

## Key Files
- `aef/execution_engine/engine.ts` - Main execution engine with memory capture
- `app/api/aef/action/[id]/route.ts` - Single-node execution endpoint
- `lib/memory/MemoryManager.ts` - Memory persistence layer
- `components/aef/MemoryPanel.tsx` - Memory visualization UI

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Memory system working for all execution types
