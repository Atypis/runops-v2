## 1. Executive Summary

On 2025-06-16 we discovered that the entire `app_frontend/lib/` directory ‚Äì **the heart of the AEF frontend and memory subsystem (‚âà10 000+ LOC)** ‚Äì was excluded from version control due to an inherited Python _.gitignore_ rule (`lib/`, `lib64/`).  As a result:

1. None of the core TypeScript source files under `lib/` were tracked in Git.  
2. Key browser-integration files (e.g. **HybridBrowserManager.ts**, **DockerBrowserManager.ts**) were vulnerable to silent loss.  
3. Two critical files were actually missing locally (HybridBrowserManager, DockerBrowserManager) causing runtime & build failures.

We have now **recovered, committed and pushed** 39 source files (‚âà87 KB) and reconstructed **HybridBrowserManager.ts** (275 LOC).  A dedicated branch `memory-system-recovery` is live on GitHub.

## 2. Timeline of Events

| Time (UTC) | Event |
|------------|-------|
| 16:20 | Developer notices missing memory data & module-not-found for `HybridBrowserManager`. |
| 16:35 | Investigation reveals `lib/` ignored by _.gitignore_. |
| 16:45 | All files in `app_frontend/lib/` added & committed (`f5158dc`). |
| 17:00 | `HybridBrowserManager.ts` recreated & committed (`849e7cc`). |
| 17:05 | New branch **memory-system-recovery** created & pushed. |
| 17:10 | Build now fails on missing `DockerBrowserManager`. |

---

## 3. Recovered / Reconstructed Assets

### 3.1 Newly Tracked (39 files)
* Memory subsystem: `lib/memory/*`
* Browser core: `lib/browser/*`
* Credentials subsystem: `lib/credentials/*`
* Workflow loaders & mappers
* React hooks (`useMemoryData`, `useCredentialStatus`)
* Type definitions (`lib/types/*`)

### 3.2 Rebuilt
* `lib/browser/HybridBrowserManager.ts` ‚Äì bridges browser actions to memory capture, exports singleton **hybridBrowserManager** expected throughout the code-base.

## 4. Outstanding Issues & Risks

| # | Area | Issue / Risk | Impact | Priority |
|---|------|--------------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Build | **`DockerBrowserManager.ts` missing** ‚Üí import errors in `start-vnc-environment`, `stop-vnc-environment`, `WebSocketServer` etc. | Blocks production build & VNC workflows | üî¥ Critical |
| 2 | Git | Detached HEAD resolved via new branch, but **main** does not yet contain fixes. | Risk of divergence / lost work | üî¥ Critical |
| 3 | Git | Possible other directories ignored inadvertently (`parts/`, `sdist/`, etc.). | Future silent losses | üü† High |
| 4 | Supabase | Code & DB migrations drifted during change-spree; need verification (`memory_artifacts` views, RLS, indexes). | Hidden runtime bugs / security gaps | üü† High |
| 5 | Env Vars | `.env` / `.env.local` not committed (correct) but may contain stale SUPABASE keys after VM resets. | Auth, storage failures | üü° Medium |
| 6 | Tests | CI never covered `lib/` previously -> **test coverage 0% for critical code**. | Regression risk | üü° Medium |
| 7 | Docs | Architecture docs (memory.md) diverged from actual code (e.g. method names). | On-boarding friction | üü¢ Low |

## 5. Immediate Action Plan

1. **Finalize Git Hygiene**  
   a. Remove any remaining source-code directories from _.gitignore_.  
   b. Run `git ls-files --others --exclude-standard` to surface anything still untracked.  
   c. Merge `memory-system-recovery` ‚ûú protected branch (PR, reviews, CI).
2. **Re-implement DockerBrowserManager**  
   Requirements (based on imports):
   * `createContainer`, `destroyContainer`, `executeAction` wrappers.  
   * Integrates with **BrowserManager** sessions & memory hooks.  
   * Starts/stops VNC-enabled Chrome container (`aef-browser`, `aef-vnc-single`).
3. **Green Build**  
   * `npm run build` should compile w/out webpack errors.  
   * Run existing Jest tests; add unit tests for new managers.
4. **Database Verification**  
   * Compare `supabase/migrations` vs live schema (`mcp_supabase_list_tables`, `get_advisors`).  
   * Ensure `memory_artifacts`: indexes, RLS, helper views intact.
5. **CI/CD Hardening**  
   * Add step to fail build if anything under `app_frontend/lib/` becomes untracked.  
   * Basic test: `import hybridBrowserManager` resolves.  
   * Lint + type-check `lib/` path.
6. **Documentation Sync**  
   * Update **memory.md** & new docs to reflect actual class/method names.

## 6. Verification Checklist

- [ ] Build completes (`npm run build`)
- [ ] `next dev` starts without 404 on HybridBrowserManager
- [ ] Memory panel displays data for a sample execution
- [ ] VNC session can be started / stopped via API endpoints
- [ ] Memory artifacts inserted into `memory_artifacts` for VNC execution
- [ ] Supabase security advisors show no new warnings

---

## 7. Longer-Term Follow-ups

1. **Lock Git Hygiene** ‚Äì Pre-commit hook rejecting *.ts* files in ignored paths.  
2. **Code Ownership** ‚Äì OWNERS for `app_frontend/lib/` to get mandatory review.  
3. **Automated Backup** ‚Äì Nightly tarball of `lib/` pushed to artifact store.  
4. **Documentation Automation** ‚Äì Generate ts-doc docs into `docs/` on CI.
