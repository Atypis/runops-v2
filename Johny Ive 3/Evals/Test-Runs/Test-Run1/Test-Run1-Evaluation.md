# Test Run 1 - Evaluation Report

## EVALUATION REPORT

**Overall Score: 5/100**

### Detailed Breakdown:
- **Record Management: 0/40**
  - Existing Updates: 0/20
  - New Records: 0/20
- **Data Accuracy: 0/35**
  - Contact Info: 0/10
  - Stage Classification: 0/10
  - Summaries: 0/15
- **Email Classification: 0/15**
  - Investor Detection: 0/10
  - Non-Investor Handling: 0/5
- **Data Integrity: 5/10**
  - No Data Loss: 0/5 (Existing data was completely lost)
  - Consistency: 5/5 (New table structure was consistent)

### Key Findings:

**Critical Failures:**
1. **Complete Data Loss**: Agent created an entirely new table instead of updating the existing CRM, resulting in 100% loss of baseline data
2. **Wrong Table Structure**: Created table with different field names than the baseline CRM
3. **No Data Population**: Despite successfully creating the table structure, no actual investor data was entered
4. **Workflow Abandonment**: Agent stopped execution before completing the core task of data transfer

**Minor Successes:**
1. **Gmail Processing**: Successfully processed Gmail emails (based on log summaries)

### Specific Errors:

**Record Management Failures:**
- **Existing Records**: All 4 baseline investor records (First Round Capital, Beta Capital, Gamma Fund, Alpha Ventures) were completely lost
- **New Records**: None of the 3 new investors (Orion Ventures, NovaCap, Evergreen Capital) were added
- **Table Structure**: Created new table with fields: "Name", "Email address", "Company", "Stage of relationship", "Summary of the interaction", "Next steps or follow-up needed" instead of using existing structure

**Data Accuracy Issues:**
- **Contact Information**: No contact data was transferred (0% accuracy)
- **Stage Classification**: No stages were classified
- **Interaction Summaries**: No summaries were created

**Email Classification Problems:**
- **Investor Detection**: Unknown - agent processed emails but didn't populate CRM
- **Non-Investor Handling**: Unknown - no evidence of proper filtering

**Data Integrity Catastrophe:**
- **Existing Data**: Completely destroyed by creating new table
- **Field Mapping**: Wrong field names used (e.g., "Email address" vs "Email", "Name" vs "Investor Name")

### Root Cause Analysis:

1. **Anti-AI Security Challenge**: Airtable's "Press and hold button" security feature significantly delayed progress
2. **Navigation Confusion**: Agent got confused about table structure and created new table instead of updating existing one
3. **Field Mapping Error**: Agent didn't understand the existing CRM schema
4. **Execution Timeout**: Agent reached step limits before completing data transfer

### Performance Grade: **FAIL (5/100)**
- **<60**: Fail - Fundamental issues

**Assessment**: This execution represents a complete system failure. The agent destroyed existing data and failed to accomplish the primary objective of updating the CRM with email information. The workflow needs fundamental redesign before attempting another run.

### Recommendations for Next Test Run:

1. **Pre-execution Setup**: Ensure agent understands existing table structure
2. **Data Preservation**: Add explicit instructions to preserve existing data
3. **Field Mapping**: Provide clear mapping between email data and CRM fields
4. **Security Handling**: Develop strategy for Airtable's anti-AI features
5. **Progress Validation**: Add checkpoints to verify data integrity throughout execution
