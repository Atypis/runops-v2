- Implemented `processWithKIMI()` method for handling KIMI requests
- Updated routing logic to use OpenRouter for KIMI models
- Added automatic fallback to GPT-4 if KIMI fails

### 3. ‚úÖ Frontend Integration
**File: `frontend/app.js`**
- Added KIMI K2 to model selection state validation
- Added KIMI K2 button to model toggle (purple color)
- Updated model indicator to show üü£ for KIMI K2
- Added tooltip showing "5x cheaper, excellent tool calling"

### 4. ‚úÖ Testing
- Created test scripts that verify:
  - Basic OpenRouter connection works
  - KIMI K2 responds correctly
  - Tool calling functions properly
  - Model detection is accurate

## How to Use

### 1. Start the Server
```bash
cd /Users/a1984/runops-v2/Johny\ Ive\ 3/test-harness/operator
