# Ticket 1.4 - Queue Job API ✅

**Objective:** Create an API route that records a new processing job in the database so a background worker can pick it up.

**Status:** Completed

**Depends On:** Ticket 1.3

**Key Tasks:**
1. ✅ Implement `app/api/queue-job/route.ts` to accept `{ jobId }` in the body.
2. ✅ Insert a row into the `jobs` table with `id = jobId`, `status = 'queued'`, and timestamp columns.
3. ✅ Return a confirmation JSON `{ status: 'queued' }` on success.
4. ✅ Validate input and handle duplicate or invalid IDs appropriately.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ Posting a valid `jobId` creates a database record with status `queued`.
- ✅ The route returns HTTP 200 with confirmation or a suitable error code on failure.

**Implementation Notes:**
- Created `app/api/queue-job/route.ts` with full jobId validation
- Added verification that the file exists in Supabase Storage before queueing
- Implemented database insertion into the jobs table with proper error handling
- Added comprehensive error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes
- Included additional job metadata in the response for client-side use
