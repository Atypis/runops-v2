# Ticket 1.5 - Status Polling and Spinner ✅

**Objective:** Provide feedback to the user during background processing by polling job status and switching the UI when processing completes.

**Status:** Completed

**Depends On:** Ticket 1.4

**Key Tasks:**
1. ✅ Implement `/api/job-status/[jobId]/route.ts` returning job information from the `jobs` table.
2. ✅ Implement SOP view at `/sop/[jobId]` that shows a spinner during processing.
3. ✅ In the SOP view, poll the status endpoint every 3s until processing completes.
4. ✅ When status becomes 'completed', render the SOP diagram.
5. ✅ Handle error states gracefully (display a message if status becomes 'error').

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ The SOP view polls the job status at the correct interval.
- ✅ Users see a spinner labeled "AI magic…" until processing completes.
- ✅ On completion, the SOP diagram is displayed automatically.

**Implementation Notes:**
- Added job status polling to the SOP view page using a 3-second interval
- Implemented a clean status management system with appropriate visual feedback
- Used different display states based on job status (queued, processing, completed, error)
- Added error handling with user-friendly messages and a button to return to the upload page
- Ensured proper cleanup of polling intervals to prevent memory leaks
