# Ticket 1.8 - Authentication and SOP History (COMPLETED)

**Objective:** Enable Google sign-in via Supabase and provide a page listing a user's previously generated SOPs.

**Depends On:** Ticket 1.7

**Key Tasks:**
1. ✅ Configure Supabase Auth in the Next.js project and add login/logout controls to the UI.
2. ✅ Secure all API routes with the authenticated user's JWT.
3. ✅ Create a "My SOPs" page that queries `sops` table for entries owned by the current user (id and created_at).
4. ✅ Link each entry to the SOP viewer route for easy access or deletion.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ Users can sign in with Google and see a list of their past SOPs.
- ✅ API endpoints reject requests without a valid JWT.
- ✅ The list page allows navigation back to each SOP viewer.

**Implementation Notes:**
- Implemented Google OAuth through Supabase Auth
- Created a Navbar component with user authentication UI
- Added shadcn/ui components for Avatar, Dropdown menu, and Toast notifications  
- Updated the database schema to add `user_id` to the `sops` table
- Implemented Row Level Security (RLS) to ensure users can only access their own SOPs
- Modified the worker to save user_id with SOPs 
- Created middleware to protect API routes and redirect unauthenticated users
- Built "My SOPs" page showing owned SOPs with links to view them
- Fixed Next.js App Router compatibility issues by separating browser and server Supabase clients

**Technical Details:**
- Used `@supabase/ssr` and `@supabase/supabase-js` packages
- Implemented RLS policies on the `sops` table to enforce user-based access
- Added the user_id to job metadata when queueing jobs
- Updated worker to extract user_id from job metadata
- Added policy exception to allow viewing SOPs with NULL user_id for backward compatibility

**Future Work:**
- Replace existing SOPs with user-owned SOPs
- Add deletion capability from the My SOPs page
- Consider pagination for users with many SOPs
- Enhance authentication UI with more feedback
