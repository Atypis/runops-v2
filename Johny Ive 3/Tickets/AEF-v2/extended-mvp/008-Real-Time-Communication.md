## 📝 Implementation Details

### Dependencies to Add
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "ws": "^8.14.0",
    "socket.io": "^4.7.0",
    "socket.io-client": "^4.7.0"
  }
}
```

### Backend Components
```
lib/realtime/
├── WebSocketServer.ts        # Main WebSocket server
├── ConnectionManager.ts      # Client connection handling
├── EventBroadcaster.ts      # Event distribution system
├── StreamingManager.ts      # Browser viewport streaming
├── CommandProcessor.ts      # Handle incoming commands
└── AuthMiddleware.ts        # WebSocket authentication
```

### Frontend Components
```
lib/realtime/
├── WebSocketClient.ts       # Client-side WebSocket manager
├── EventSubscriber.ts       # Event subscription handling
├── StreamingReceiver.ts     # Browser stream rendering
├── CommandSender.ts         # Send commands to backend
└── ReconnectionHandler.ts   # Connection recovery logic
```

### Real-time Events
```typescript
// Execution events
interface ExecutionUpdateEvent {
  type: 'execution_update';
  executionId: string;
  status: ExecutionStatus;
  currentStep?: string;
  progress: number;
  timestamp: Date;
}

// Step events
interface StepUpdateEvent {
  type: 'step_update';
  executionId: string;
  stepId: string;
  status: StepStatus;
  result?: StepResult;
  timestamp: Date;
}

// Browser events
interface BrowserUpdateEvent {
  type: 'browser_update';
  sessionId: string;
  screenshot?: string; // base64 encoded
  url?: string;
  timestamp: Date;
}

// Checkpoint events
interface CheckpointEvent {
  type: 'checkpoint_required';
  executionId: string;
  stepId: string;
  checkpointData: CheckpointData;
  timestamp: Date;
}
```

## 🤔 Key Design Decisions Needed

### 1. **WebSocket Library Choice**
**Decision Required**: Which WebSocket library should be used?
- **Option A**: Native WebSocket API (lightweight, manual handling)
- **Option B**: Socket.IO (feature-rich, automatic fallbacks)
- **Option C**: ws library with custom wrapper (middle ground)

**Impact**: Affects features, reliability, and development complexity

### 2. **Event Broadcasting Strategy**
**Decision Required**: How should events be distributed to clients?
- **Option A**: Room-based broadcasting (per execution/user)
- **Option B**: Direct client targeting (point-to-point)
- **Option C**: Hybrid approach (rooms + direct messaging)

**Impact**: Affects scalability and event delivery accuracy

### 3. **Browser Streaming Method**
**Decision Required**: How should browser viewport be streamed?
- **Option A**: Static screenshots at intervals (simple)
- **Option B**: Compressed video stream (smooth but bandwidth-heavy)
- **Option C**: Delta-based updates (efficient but complex)

**Impact**: Affects user experience and bandwidth usage

### 4. **Connection Reliability Strategy**
**Decision Required**: How should connection failures be handled?
- **Option A**: Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- **Option B**: Manual reconnection with user notification
- **Option C**: Hybrid with configurable strategies

**Impact**: Affects user experience during network issues

### 5. **Authentication Model**
**Decision Required**: How should WebSocket connections be authenticated?
- **Option A**: Token-based authentication on connection
- **Option B**: Session-based with existing auth system
- **Option C**: Per-message authentication

**Impact**: Affects security and implementation complexity

### 6. **Message Queuing Strategy**
**Decision Required**: How should messages be handled during disconnections?
- **Option A**: No queuing (messages lost during disconnection)
- **Option B**: Server-side queuing with replay on reconnection
- **Option C**: Client-side queuing with conflict resolution

**Impact**: Affects data consistency and complexity

### 7. **Scaling Strategy**
**Decision Required**: How should the system handle multiple concurrent users?
- **Option A**: Single WebSocket server (simple but limited)
- **Option B**: Load-balanced WebSocket servers with shared state
- **Option C**: Distributed architecture with message broker

**Impact**: Affects system scalability and architecture complexity
