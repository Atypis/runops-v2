0. What Are We Building?

We're building a system that can take a screen recording of a human performing a workflow in the browser â€” say, updating a CRM based on emails â€” and turn it into a reliable, transparent agentic execution pipeline. The long-term goal is to create a hybrid automation system: deterministic where it makes sense, powered by LLMs where flexibility is needed, with the human always in control.

1. Desired End State

1.1 MVP Vision: Reliable Browser-Based Execution with High Control

The MVP is focused, narrow, and concrete:
We want to go from a screen recording â†’ to a structured SOP â†’ to a machine-readable execution graph that can be run by an agent in the browser with 90%+ reliability.

For this, we're building an agentic execution framework that:
	â€¢	Takes a known SOP (for now, hard-coded until it works and we can reverse an agent that reliably builds these SOPs),
	â€¢	Executes it inside a live, containerized browser (via StageHand),
	â€¢	Lets the human observe every action being taken,
	â€¢	And allows us to debug, validate, and iterate precisely.

The key constraint for the MVP: everything happens in the browser. No desktop apps, no complex human-agent handoffs yet.

But crucially â€” and this is the core differentiator â€” this is not a black box.
The system is high-control, semi-deterministic, and intentionally transparent. Unlike "YOLO" agent frameworks (e.g., Browser-Use-style), which you just throw a high-level task at and hope it works, this approach emphasizes repeatability and observability. You know what each node is doing, when, and why. That matters.

Why control?
Because when we initially tested more freeform agents, a few key issues emerged:
	â€¢	Zero transparency: You couldn't tell what the agent was doing or why it failed.
	â€¢	Unreliable pathing: It might take route A this time, route B next time.
	â€¢	Context blow-up: With complex tasks (like reading 20+ emails), agents lost track of state due to DOM snapshot overload and token window limits.
	â€¢	Low trust: You couldn't hand it off and expect it to work consistently.

Instead, our approach balances flexibility with structure. The initial execution might be exploratory (using LLMs to figure out paths), but then the system locks in those paths, caching DOM selectors or decision patterns (caching is also future vision, not radical mvp). Over time, it becomes more deterministic, more repeatable â€” while still keeping LLMs in the loop for decision points, generating content, ambiguity, exception handling, or one-off reasoning tasks.

That emphasis on control and transparency is what makes this viable for real workflows.

1.2 Future Vision: Generalized, Trusted Human-AI Collaboration

Once the MVP proves itself, we expand.

Key future pillars:
	â€¢	Desktop compatibility: Not just browsers â€” the same execution logic extended to desktop apps (e.g., via OS-level automation).
	â€¢	Human-in-the-loop checkpoints: Insert review gates. For example, after generating a report, the agent pauses and prompts the human: "Ready to send?"
	â€¢	Dynamic uncertainty flags: The agent knows when it's unsure and can explicitly request human help.
	â€¢	Persistent memory + workflow reuse: Over time, the system becomes more knowledgeable, less exploratory, and increasingly autonomous â€” while maintaining transparency.
	â€¢	Trust through consistency: The human sees every step, builds confidence, and eventually can fire off entire workflows with only critical checkpoints.

In the long run, the vision is to have an AI teammate â€” not a black box executor â€” that handles workflows with precision, predictability, and accountability.

2. How We're Getting There: The 9-Primitive System

After weighing our options, we've committed to building the right system from the ground up. We've radically simplified our approach to 9 canonical primitives that compose like LEGO blocks.

â¸»

2.1 The Chosen Path: Clean Primitives First

We paused the brute-force approach and identified exactly 9 orthogonal primitives needed for any browser automation:

**Execution Layer (4 primitives):**
â€¢ `browser_action` - Side-effectful browser operations (goto, click, type, openNewTab, switchTab)
â€¢ `browser_query` - Data extraction without side effects (extract, observe)
â€¢ `transform` - Pure data manipulation with JavaScript functions
â€¢ `cognition` - AI-powered reasoning and content generation

**Control Layer (4 primitives):**
â€¢ `sequence` - Serial execution of nodes
â€¢ `iterate` - Loops with proper variable scoping
â€¢ `route` - Multi-way branching based on state values
â€¢ `handle` - Error boundaries with recovery options

**State Layer (1 primitive):**
â€¢ `memory` - Explicit state management (set, get, clear, merge)

â¸»

2.2 The Test Harness: Rapid Validation

To validate these primitives quickly, we built a lean test harness that gives us:
â€¢ **10-second feedback loops** (vs 5-minute Docker rebuilds)
â€¢ **Live browser** you can see and debug
â€¢ **Visual dashboard** for triggering individual nodes
â€¢ **Hot reload** with watch mode
â€¢ **Direct StageHand/OpenAI integration**

This isn't just for testing â€” it's our laboratory for discovering the right abstractions.

2.3 Current Status

âœ… **What's Working:**
â€¢ All 9 primitives implemented and functional
â€¢ Gmail login flow executing reliably
â€¢ Multi-tab support (Gmail + Airtable simultaneously)
â€¢ Basic email extraction and classification
â€¢ Visual debugging accelerates development

ðŸš§ **What We're Solving:**
â€¢ Gmail 2FA handling (needs `handle` primitive refinement)
â€¢ Robust email pagination and extraction
â€¢ Investor classification accuracy
â€¢ Idempotency (not processing emails twice)
â€¢ Error recovery patterns

ðŸ“Š **Success Metrics:**
â€¢ Gmailâ†’Airtable workflow at 90%+ reliability
â€¢ Each primitive has clear input/output contract
â€¢ New node implementation in <5 minutes
â€¢ Debug cycle in <30 seconds

3. Helpful Context

This section outlines how the system is currently structured, what technologies are in use, and some of the key technical and design decisions that have shaped the current setup. It also provides the necessary grounding to understand why the current version looks the way it does â€” and what the pain points are.

â¸»

3.1 Current System Architecture

**Test Harness Setup:**
â€¢ **Frontend**: React dashboard at localhost:3001 with visual node execution and state viewer
â€¢ **Backend**: Express server implementing all 9 primitives, connected to StageHand
â€¢ **Browser**: Chrome with remote debugging (port 9222) â€” persistent sessions, no Docker needed
â€¢ **AI Integration**: StageHand wraps Playwright with GPT-4o-mini for intelligent element selection

**Execution Flow:**
â€¢ JSON workflow definitions using the 9 primitives
â€¢ Each primitive maps to specific StageHand/Playwright commands
â€¢ State flows through a shared `workflowState` object
â€¢ Multi-tab support with named tab management
â€¢ Real-time logs and state visibility

3.2 The Canonical Gmailâ†’Airtable Workflow

Our test workflow follows these phases:

**Phase 1: Setup**
â€¢ Login to Gmail (with 2FA handling)
â€¢ Open Airtable in new tab
â€¢ Authenticate both services

**Phase 2: Extract & Filter**
â€¢ Search Gmail for date range
â€¢ Extract emails using defined schema
â€¢ Use AI to classify investor-related emails
â€¢ Filter to investorEmails array

**Phase 3: Process Loop**
â€¢ For each investor email:
  - Extract thread content
  - Generate CRM summary
  - Switch to Airtable tab
  - Create/update record
  - Mark as processed
  - Switch back to Gmail

**Deduplication**: Tracks processed emails by subject to prevent duplicates.

3.3 Why Browser-Based?
	â€¢	The MVP limits scope to browser-based workflows.
	â€¢	Tools like Playwright and StageHand make it relatively tractable to manipulate browser UIs.
	â€¢	Long-term, the execution logic may be extended to desktop apps, but this first step is meant to reduce variables and control complexity.

â¸»

3.4 Why This Approach?

**Why Not Generic Agents?**
Earlier attempts with "YOLO" frameworks (BrowserAgent, Browser-Use) failed because:
â€¢ Zero transparency â€” couldn't debug failures
â€¢ Non-deterministic â€” different behavior each run
â€¢ Context overflow â€” lost track after 20+ steps
â€¢ No trust â€” couldn't run unattended

**Why 9 Primitives?**
â€¢ **Orthogonal**: Each does ONE thing well
â€¢ **Composable**: Complex behaviors from simple building blocks
â€¢ **Observable**: Every step is transparent
â€¢ **Deterministic**: Same inputs â†’ same outputs (except AI ops)

**Why a Test Harness?**
â€¢ Fast iteration reveals the right abstractions
â€¢ Every hack teaches us what's missing
â€¢ Every pattern shows how developers will use it
â€¢ Every fix saves hours in production

## 4. Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Achieve 90%+ reliability on Gmailâ†’Airtable workflow
2. **Short-term**: Document composition patterns and error handling strategies
3. **Medium-term**: Migrate validated primitives to production AEF
4. **Long-term**: Generate workflows from recordings using proven primitives

The test harness isn't just for testing â€” it's how we build the right thing, not just something that works.
