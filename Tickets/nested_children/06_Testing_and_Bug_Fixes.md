# Ticket: Testing and Bug Fixes for Nested Node Implementation

## Objective
Thoroughly test the nested node implementation across various scenarios, identify and fix common bugs, and ensure the system handles edge cases appropriately.

## Requirements

1. Create test scenarios for nested structures:
   - Simple two-level nesting (Step -> child Steps)
   - Three-level nesting (Loop -> Step -> Steps)
   - Multiple siblings that are containers
   - Mixed node types in nested hierarchies
   - Very large containers with many children

2. Test and fix common layout issues:
   - Children overlapping parent headers
   - Children escaping parent boundaries
   - Incorrect sizing of parent containers
   - Improper spacing between siblings or levels
   - Layout issues after collapse/expand operations

3. Verify edge handling in nested structures:
   - Edges connecting nodes across different containers
   - Edges connecting parents to their children
   - Edge routing around container boundaries
   - Edge behavior during collapse/expand operations

4. Test performance with complex diagrams:
   - Diagrams with multiple levels of nesting
   - Containers with large numbers of children
   - Many expand/collapse operations in sequence
   - Initial layout performance with deeply nested structures

5. Address z-index and interaction issues:
   - Ensure clicking on child nodes doesn't select parents
   - Verify that container backgrounds don't obscure child nodes
   - Test dragging behavior with nested nodes
   - Verify selection behavior works correctly with nested structures

## Acceptance Criteria

- All test scenarios render correctly without visual defects
- Layout remains stable and correct during various operations
- No overlapping elements or nodes escaping their containers
- Edge routing is clean and understandable
- Performance remains acceptable with complex nested structures
- Interactions (clicking, dragging, expanding/collapsing) work as expected
- No regressions in existing functionality

## Technical Notes

- Create a set of test SOP data structures with various nesting patterns
- Document any edge cases or limitations discovered during testing
- Consider adding automated tests if possible
- Monitor browser performance and memory usage with complex diagrams
- Update documentation to reflect any discovered limitations or best practices
