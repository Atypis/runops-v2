# Nested Children Implementation Plan

This folder contains tickets for implementing multi-level nested node visualization in the ReactFlow SOP diagram. The implementation allows any node type (including regular steps) to act as a parent container for child nodes, supporting multiple levels of nesting.

## Implementation Overview

The current system allows loop nodes to contain children, but has limitations with multi-level nesting and other node types serving as containers. This implementation generalizes the compound-node approach so any node with children can act as a parent container, preserving the vertical flow layout.

## Tickets in Order of Implementation

1. **Data Transformation Updates** - Update the data transformation logic to properly handle multi-level nesting
2. **StepNode Container Enhancement** - Modify the StepNode component to properly render as a container for child nodes
3. **Layout Algorithm Improvements** - Enhance the layout algorithm to handle multi-level nesting
4. **Collapse/Expand Functionality** - Implement robust collapse/expand mechanisms for nested nodes
5. **Visual Structure and Styling** - Establish consistent visual styling for nested nodes
6. **Testing and Bug Fixes** - Test the implementation across various scenarios and fix issues
7. **Documentation and Refinement** - Document the implementation and refine based on feedback

## Key Objectives

- **Universal Compound Nodes**: Allow any SOP node type to visually contain its children
- **Multi-level Nesting**: Support multiple levels of nesting (children with their own children)
- **Layout Integrity**: Maintain proper positioning and sizing of container nodes
- **Spacing & Sizing**: Properly adjust container dimensions to accommodate children
- **Leverage Existing Patterns**: Extend the logic from loop nodes to other node types

## Dependencies

These tickets build on each other sequentially. The data transformation must be updated first, followed by component enhancements, then layout improvements, and finally the collapse/expand functionality.

## Testing

The implementation should be tested with various nesting scenarios:
- Simple two-level nesting (Step -> child Steps)
- Three-level nesting (Loop -> Step -> Steps)
- Multiple siblings that are containers
- Mixed node types in nested hierarchies
