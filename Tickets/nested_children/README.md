# Nested Children Implementation - Depth-Aware Full-Width Container Strategy

This folder contains the implementation plan for a scalable multi-level nested node visualization system using a **depth-aware full-width container strategy**. This approach allows any node type to act as a container while maintaining visual clarity and layout integrity across unlimited nesting levels.

## Strategy Overview

Our solution uses a **full-width container approach** where:
- **Regular nodes** follow normal grid layout (2-N per row based on container width)
- **Container nodes** always span full parent width and force a new row  
- **Width inheritance** uses proportional sizing (`floor(parent * 0.8)`) with minimum of 1
- **Depth analysis** calculates max nesting depth first, then determines root container width accordingly

This approach is scalable, visually clear, and handles complex nested structures robustly.

## Example Layout Structure
```
Root Container (4-wide, max depth=4):
├─ Row 1: [Step] [Step] [Step] [Step]
├─ Row 2: [Step] [Step] [---] [---]                     <- partial row
├─ Row 3: [CONTAINER spanning full 4-wide]              <- forces new row
│  ├─ Row 1: [Step] [Step] [Step]                       <- 3-wide (floor(4*0.8))
│  └─ Row 2: [SUB-CONTAINER spanning full 3-wide]       <- forces new row
│     ├─ Row 1: [Step] [Step]                           <- 2-wide (floor(3*0.8))
│     └─ Row 2: [DEEP-CONTAINER spanning full 2-wide]   <- forces new row
│        └─ Row 1: [Step]                               <- 1-wide (floor(2*0.8))
└─ Row 4: [Step] [Step] [Step] [Step]                   <- continues main grid
```

## Implementation Tickets

### **01_Core_Layout_Algorithm.md** ⭐ **START HERE**
The foundation ticket implementing the depth-aware layout algorithm:
- Depth analysis functions for calculating max nesting and container widths
- Recursive layout algorithm with full-width container logic
- Enhanced positioning system for multi-level structures
- Integration with existing DAGRE layout for top-level nodes

**Key deliverables**: New layout functions, depth calculation, recursive positioning

### **02_UI_Components_Containers.md** 
UI component updates to support universal container rendering:
- Enhance StepNode for container support (similar to existing LoopNode)
- Implement depth-based visual hierarchy with color coding
- Add robust collapse/expand functionality for multi-level nesting
- Container size indicators and metadata display

**Key deliverables**: Enhanced components, visual styling, expand/collapse UI

### **03_Testing_Polish_Edge_Cases.md**
Comprehensive testing, performance optimization, and production polish:
- Systematic test coverage for all nesting scenarios
- Edge case handling (malformed data, performance limits)
- Browser compatibility and accessibility compliance
- Performance optimization and user experience polish

**Key deliverables**: Test suite, edge case handling, performance optimization

## Implementation Order

**Sequential implementation is recommended:**
1. Complete Ticket 01 first - establishes the core layout foundation
2. Then Ticket 02 - builds UI components on the new layout system  
3. Finally Ticket 03 - tests and polishes the complete implementation

## Test Data

Use these files for testing multi-level nesting scenarios:
- `app_frontend/public/latest-sop-v0.8.json` - Real nested structure with 3+ levels
- `app_frontend/public/mocksop-original-structure.json` - Additional test patterns

Example nested structure from test data:
```
L1_process_daily_emails (loop)
└── L1_C3_process_investor_logic (step with 7 children)
    ├── L2_C1_check_investor_exists
    ├── L2_C2_update_investor_record  
    └── L2_C3_send_notification
```

## Key Benefits

✅ **Scalable**: Handles unlimited nesting levels without layout failures  
✅ **Universal**: Any node type can be a container (not just loops)  
✅ **Visual Clarity**: Progressive visual hierarchy with depth-based styling  
✅ **Maintainable**: Builds on existing patterns and ReactFlow capabilities  
✅ **Performance**: Efficient recursive algorithm with proper memoization  

## Technical Architecture

- **Layout Engine**: Recursive full-width container algorithm  
- **UI Framework**: ReactFlow with enhanced compound node support
- **State Management**: Centralized expand/collapse state with ReactFlow integration
- **Styling System**: Depth-aware visual hierarchy with container type differentiation
- **Data Transform**: Enhanced SOP-to-Flow conversion with depth analysis

This implementation provides a robust foundation for complex SOP visualization while maintaining the existing system's performance and usability.
