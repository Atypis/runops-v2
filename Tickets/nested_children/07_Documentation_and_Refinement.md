# Ticket: Documentation and Refinement of Nested Node Implementation

## Objective
Document the nested node implementation, create usage examples, refine the implementation based on feedback, and ensure the solution is well-documented for future maintenance.

## Requirements

1. Update technical documentation:
   - Document the updated data structure for nested nodes
   - Describe how the layout algorithm handles multi-level nesting
   - Explain the expand/collapse mechanism and its implementation
   - Document any new props or configuration options added

2. Create usage examples and guidelines:
   - Provide examples of how to create nested SOP structures
   - Document best practices for structuring nested SOPs
   - Identify recommended patterns and anti-patterns
   - Create visual examples of well-structured nested diagrams

3. Refine implementation based on feedback:
   - Gather feedback from users on the nested node implementation
   - Address any usability issues identified
   - Fine-tune styling, spacing, and visual appearance
   - Optimize performance based on real-world usage

4. Document known limitations and future improvements:
   - Identify any edge cases or limitations in the current implementation
   - Document workarounds for known issues
   - Propose future improvements or enhancements
   - Create tracking issues for any deferred improvements

5. Update the ReactFlow architecture documentation:
   - Update the `SOPReactFlowArchitecture.md` document with nested node details
   - Explain the relationship between data structure and visual rendering
   - Document the component hierarchy and responsibilities
   - Provide diagrams or illustrations of the nested structure

## Acceptance Criteria

- Complete technical documentation for the nested node implementation
- Clear usage examples and guidelines for creating nested SOPs
- Refined implementation based on user feedback
- Documented known limitations and future improvement plans
- Updated architecture documentation that reflects the new capabilities
- Documentation is clear, accurate, and helpful for future developers

## Technical Notes

- Consider creating a dedicated example or playground for nested nodes
- Use code snippets, diagrams, and screenshots in documentation
- Ensure documentation covers both technical implementation and user guidance
- Align documentation with existing project standards and formats
- Include performance considerations and best practices in documentation
