# ‚öôÔ∏è Ticket 007: Core Execution Engine

## üìã Summary
Build the core execution engine that orchestrates step-by-step workflow execution, manages execution state, handles step dependencies, and provides granular control over automation progress.

## üéØ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Step-by-step execution engine implemented
- [ ] Execution state management and persistence
- [ ] Individual step control (run, pause, skip, retry)
- [ ] Dependency resolution and ordering
- [ ] Progress tracking and real-time updates
- [ ] Execution logging and audit trail

## üìù Implementation Details

### Backend Components
```
lib/execution/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ExecutionEngine.ts         # Main orchestration engine
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ StepExecutor.ts           # Individual step execution
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ExecutionState.ts         # State management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ DependencyResolver.ts     # Step ordering and dependencies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ProgressTracker.ts        # Progress calculation and updates
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ExecutionLogger.ts        # Audit trail and logging
```

### Core Classes
```typescript
// Main execution engine
class ExecutionEngine {
  async startExecution(aefDocument: AEFDocument): Promise<string>;
  async pauseExecution(executionId: string): Promise<void>;
  async resumeExecution(executionId: string): Promise<void>;
  async stopExecution(executionId: string): Promise<void>;
  async executeStep(executionId: string, stepId: string): Promise<StepResult>;
  getExecutionState(executionId: string): Promise<ExecutionState>;
}

// Individual step execution
class StepExecutor {
  async executeStep(step: SOPNode, context: ExecutionContext): Promise<StepResult>;
  async validatePrerequisites(step: SOPNode, context: ExecutionContext): Promise<boolean>;
  async handleStepError(step: SOPNode, error: Error, context: ExecutionContext): Promise<StepResult>;
}

// Execution state management
class ExecutionState {
  id: string;
  status: ExecutionStatus;
  currentStep?: string;
  completedSteps: Set<string>;
  failedSteps: Map<string, Error>;
  context: ExecutionContext;
  progress: ProgressInfo;
}
```

### Step Execution Flow
```typescript
// Step execution lifecycle
enum StepStatus {
  PENDING = 'pending',
  RUNNING = 'running',
  COMPLETED = 'completed',
  FAILED = 'failed',
  SKIPPED = 'skipped',
  BLOCKED = 'blocked'
}

// Execution context for variable passing
interface ExecutionContext {
  variables: Map<string, any>;
  browserSession?: BrowserSession;
  executionId: string;
  userId: string;
  sopData: AEFDocument;
}
```

## ü§î Key Design Decisions Needed

### 1. **Step Execution Model** ‚úÖ DECIDED
**Chosen**: Option A (Sequential only) for MVP
- One step executed at a time in workflow order
- Simplified execution flow and state management
- Future enhancement: Parallel execution for independent steps

**Impact**: Predictable execution order with simplified debugging

### 2. **State Persistence Strategy** ‚úÖ DECIDED
**Chosen**: Option A (After each step completion)
- Execution state saved after each step and checkpoint
- Enables reliable recovery from failures or interruptions
- Balances reliability with database performance

**Impact**: Reliable execution recovery without excessive database load

### 3. **Variable Scope Management** ‚úÖ DECIDED
**Chosen**: Option A (Global scope)
- Shared ExecutionContext with Map<string, any> for all variables
- All steps can read/write to the global variable space
- Simple debugging with complete variable visibility

**Impact**: Simplified variable management and data flow

### 4. **Error Propagation Strategy** ‚úÖ DECIDED
**Chosen**: Option A (Fail fast) for MVP
- Step failures stop execution immediately
- Clear error presentation to user with retry options
- Future enhancement: Continue-on-error policies for non-critical steps

**Impact**: Clear error handling with manual recovery control

### 5. **Loop Execution Handling** ‚úÖ DECIDED
**Chosen**: Option A (Expand loops into individual steps)
- Loop discovery phase creates individual step instances
- Each loop iteration becomes an executable step with checkpoints
- UI shows loop progress with individual step controls

**Impact**: Granular loop control with clear progress visualization

### 6. **Dependency Resolution** ‚úÖ DECIDED
**Chosen**: Option A (Static analysis from SOP structure)
- Step order determined by existing edges and parentId relationships
- No additional dependency declaration required
- Leverages existing SOP structure for execution order

**Impact**: Reuses existing SOP structure without additional complexity

### 7. **Progress Calculation** ‚úÖ DECIDED
**Chosen**: Option A (Simple step count)
- Progress = completed steps / total steps * 100
- Clear, predictable progress indication
- Future enhancement: Weighted progress by step complexity

**Impact**: Simple, understandable progress tracking
