# üöÄ Radical MVP - Essential AEF Implementation

## üìã Overview
The **Radical MVP** contains the absolute minimum tickets needed to prove the core AEF concept and create the "holy shit, this actually works" moment. This implementation focuses on the essential user journey with maximum impact and minimum complexity.

## üéØ Core Experience
**User Journey**: User has existing SOP ‚Üí clicks "Transform to AEF" ‚Üí sees live browser automation ‚Üí approves checkpoints ‚Üí workflow completes

**Value Proposition**: "Watch your manual workflow become automated in real-time, with you in control"

## ‚úÖ Key Architectural Decisions

### **Checkpoint Control Strategy**
- **Workflow Level**: Toggle between "Run with checkpoints" OR "Run automatically"
- **Step Level**: Individual step approval for maximum safety
- **MVP**: Simple "before execution" checkpoint for every step when enabled
- **Impact**: Users get both efficiency (auto mode) and control (checkpoint mode)

### **Browser Automation Architecture** 
- **Engine**: Self-hosted Stagehand + Playwright (not Browserbase for MVP)
- **Sessions**: One fresh browser session per workflow execution
- **Streaming**: Screenshot polling every 2-3 seconds (not real-time video)
- **Impact**: Simple deployment with predictable resource usage

### **Execution & State Management**
- **Execution**: Sequential steps only (no parallelism for MVP)
- **Variables**: Global execution context shared across all steps
- **Persistence**: Save state after each step completion and checkpoint
- **Impact**: Simplified debugging and reliable execution recovery

### **Error Handling Strategy**
- **Approach**: Fail fast with immediate user notification
- **Recovery**: Simple "refresh and try again" mechanism
- **Impact**: Clear error states with manual recovery control

## ‚ö° MVP Tickets (7 Total)

### **Foundation Layer**
**001 - AEF Data Models** (Simplified)
- Basic `AEFDocument` extension only
- Simple execution states (`idle`, `running`, `completed`, `error`)
- Global context only - no complex variable scope

**003 - API Infrastructure** (Minimal)
- Essential endpoints: transform, execute, status, checkpoint
- HTTP polling instead of real-time WebSockets
- Basic authentication and error handling

**004 - UI Framework** (Basic)
- Fixed tri-panel layout (40/40/20 split)
- Simple view mode toggle (List | Flow | **AEF**)
- No responsive design or dynamic adaptation

### **Transform Magic**
**005 - Transform Button** (Essential)
- Transform button with basic loading animation
- Hardcoded checkpoint placement (before each step)
- Simple success/error states

**006 - Browser Integration** (Core)
- Basic Stagehand/Playwright integration
- Screenshot polling every 2-3 seconds
- Single browser session per user

### **Execution Flow**
**007 - Execution Engine** (Sequential)
- Sequential step execution only (no parallelism)
- Simple state persistence after each step
- Basic error = stop execution

**009 - Checkpoint System** (Human Control)
- Modal dialog checkpoints only
- Simple approve/reject buttons
- Manual approval required for every step

## üîß Radical Simplifications

### **No Database Schema Changes**
- Use existing `sops` table + `aef_config` JSONB column
- Simple `aef_executions` table for state tracking
- No complex migrations or new relationships

### **Screenshot Polling Instead of Live Streaming**
- HTTP polling every 2-3 seconds for browser state
- Base64 encoded screenshots in API responses
- No WebSocket complexity or real-time infrastructure

### **Hardcoded Checkpoints**
- Checkpoint before every single step
- Simple modal: "About to [action]. Continue?" ‚Üí Approve/Reject
- No timeout handling or advanced checkpoint types

### **Basic Error Handling**
- Error = stop execution immediately
- "Refresh and try again" for browser issues
- No automatic retry or recovery mechanisms

## ‚è∞ Implementation Timeline

**Week 1-2: Foundation**
- Set up data models and basic API infrastructure
- Create tri-panel UI layout and view toggle
- **Milestone**: Can switch to AEF view mode

**Week 3-4: Transform Magic**
- Implement transform button and conversion logic
- Integrate browser automation with screenshot polling
- **Milestone**: Can transform SOP and see browser automation

**Week 5-6: Execution Flow**
- Build sequential execution engine
- Add checkpoint modal system
- **Milestone**: Complete end-to-end workflow execution

**Total: ~6 weeks** for working demo

## üé™ Demo Script

1. **Show existing SOP** in ReactFlow view
   - "Here's a manual workflow I created from a video"

2. **Click "ü§ñ Transform to AEF"** 
   - Loading animation: "Analyzing workflow... Configuring checkpoints... Ready!"

3. **Switch to AEF view**
   - Show tri-panel layout with execution controls

4. **Click "‚ñ∂Ô∏è Start Execution"**
   - Browser window appears in right panel
   - Screenshot updates every few seconds

5. **First checkpoint appears**
   - Modal: "About to navigate to Gmail. Continue?" ‚Üí Approve

6. **Watch automation happen**
   - "Step 2 of 8 - Clicking compose button..."
   - Screenshot shows Gmail interface

7. **Another checkpoint**
   - "About to submit form. Continue?" ‚Üí Approve

8. **Execution completes**
   - "‚úÖ Workflow completed successfully in 2 minutes!"

## üö´ What's NOT in MVP

- **No Real-time WebSockets** ‚Üí HTTP polling
- **No Advanced Error Recovery** ‚Üí Basic retry button  
- **No Dynamic Loops** ‚Üí Hardcoded simple loops
- **No AI Learning** ‚Üí No pattern recognition
- **No Analytics Dashboard** ‚Üí Basic execution logs
- **No Template Library** ‚Üí No sharing or patterns
- **No Complex Database Schema** ‚Üí JSON fields only
- **No Dynamic UI** ‚Üí Fixed layout only

## ‚úÖ Why This Works

**Proves Core Magic**: Live browser automation with human control  
**Maximum Impact**: "Wow factor" with minimal complexity  
**Buildable Timeline**: 6 weeks is achievable  
**Foundation for Growth**: Can add extended features later  
**Clear Success Criteria**: Working demo that impresses users
