- [ ] Checkpoint configuration interface for users
- [ ] Real-time checkpoint approval modals/dialogs
- [ ] Multiple checkpoint types (before/after/error/custom)
- [ ] Timeout handling for unapproved checkpoints
- [ ] Checkpoint bypass and bulk approval options
- [ ] Audit trail for all checkpoint interactions

## üìù Implementation Details

### Frontend Components
```
components/aef/checkpoint/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CheckpointModal.tsx          # Main approval dialog
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CheckpointQueue.tsx          # Queue of pending checkpoints
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CheckpointConfig.tsx         # Configuration interface
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CheckpointHistory.tsx        # Historical checkpoint log
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ BulkApprovalPanel.tsx        # Batch checkpoint handling
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ CheckpointPreview.tsx        # Preview what will happen
```

### Backend Components
```
lib/checkpoint/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CheckpointManager.ts         # Core checkpoint handling
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CheckpointValidator.ts       # Validate checkpoint conditions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TimeoutHandler.ts           # Handle checkpoint timeouts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ApprovalProcessor.ts        # Process user responses
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ CheckpointLogger.ts         # Audit trail logging
```

### Checkpoint Types
```typescript
// Checkpoint configuration
interface CheckpointConfig {
  stepId: string;
  type: CheckpointType;
  condition?: CheckpointCondition;
  timeout?: number; // seconds
  autoApprove?: boolean;
  requiredData?: string[];
}

enum CheckpointType {
  BEFORE_EXECUTION = 'before_execution',
  AFTER_EXECUTION = 'after_execution', 
  ON_ERROR = 'on_error',
  DATA_VALIDATION = 'data_validation',
  MANUAL_REVIEW = 'manual_review',
  CUSTOM = 'custom'
}

// Checkpoint data for user review
interface CheckpointData {
  stepId: string;
  stepName: string;
  description: string;
  currentContext: ExecutionContext;
  previewData?: any;
  risksAndImpacts?: string[];
  suggestedAction?: CheckpointAction;
}

enum CheckpointAction {
  APPROVE = 'approve',
  REJECT = 'reject', 
  SKIP = 'skip',
  MODIFY = 'modify',
  RETRY = 'retry'
}
```

### Checkpoint Modal Design
```typescript
// Main checkpoint approval interface
interface CheckpointModalProps {
  checkpoint: CheckpointData;
  onResponse: (action: CheckpointAction, data?: any) => void;
  onTimeout: () => void;
  timeoutSeconds?: number;
  isVisible: boolean;
}

// Checkpoint queue management
interface CheckpointQueueProps {
  checkpoints: CheckpointData[];
  onBulkApprove: (checkpointIds: string[]) => void;
  onBulkReject: (checkpointIds: string[]) => void;
  maxVisible?: number;
}
```

## ü§î Key Design Decisions Needed

### 1. **Checkpoint Configuration Granularity**
**Decision Required**: How detailed should checkpoint configuration be?
- **Option A**: Simple on/off per step
- **Option B**: Type-based configuration (before/after/error)
- **Option C**: Condition-based rules engine

**Impact**: Affects user control complexity and system flexibility

### 2. **Timeout Behavior**
**Decision Required**: What should happen when checkpoints timeout?
- **Option A**: Automatic approval (proceed with caution)
- **Option B**: Automatic rejection (stop execution)
- **Option C**: User-configurable default action

**Impact**: Affects automation reliability and user experience

### 3. **Checkpoint UI Presentation**
**Decision Required**: How should checkpoints be presented to users?
- **Option A**: Modal dialogs (blocking, focused)
- **Option B**: Side panel notifications (non-blocking)
- **Option C**: Dedicated checkpoint management interface

**Impact**: Affects workflow interruption and user attention

### 4. **Bulk Approval Strategy**
**Decision Required**: How should multiple checkpoints be handled?
- **Option A**: Individual approval only (safest)
- **Option B**: Batch approval for similar checkpoints
- **Option C**: Smart grouping with pattern recognition

**Impact**: Affects efficiency vs safety trade-off

### 5. **Context Information Depth**
**Decision Required**: How much context should be shown at checkpoints?
- **Option A**: Minimal (step name and action)
- **Option B**: Moderate (current state and next action)
- **Option C**: Complete (full execution context and preview)

**Impact**: Affects user decision quality and interface complexity

### 6. **Checkpoint Persistence**
**Decision Required**: How should checkpoint state be managed across sessions?
- **Option A**: Session-only (lost on refresh)
- **Option B**: Persistent with cleanup after resolution
- **Option C**: Full historical record keeping

**Impact**: Affects reliability and audit capabilities

### 7. **Multi-User Checkpoint Handling**
**Decision Required**: How should checkpoints work in team environments?
- **Option A**: Creator-only approval
- **Option B**: Delegated approval to team members
- **Option C**: Consensus-based approval system

**Impact**: Affects collaboration and workflow sharing
