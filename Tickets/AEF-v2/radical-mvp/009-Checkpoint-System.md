- [ ] Real-time checkpoint approval modals/dialogs
- [ ] Multiple checkpoint types (before/after/error/custom)
- [ ] Timeout handling for unapproved checkpoints
- [ ] Checkpoint bypass and bulk approval options
- [ ] Audit trail for all checkpoint interactions

## üìù Implementation Details

### Frontend Components
```
components/aef/checkpoint/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CheckpointModal.tsx          # Main approval dialog
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CheckpointQueue.tsx          # Queue of pending checkpoints
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CheckpointConfig.tsx         # Configuration interface
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CheckpointHistory.tsx        # Historical checkpoint log
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ BulkApprovalPanel.tsx        # Batch checkpoint handling
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ CheckpointPreview.tsx        # Preview what will happen
```

### Backend Components
```
lib/checkpoint/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CheckpointManager.ts         # Core checkpoint handling
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CheckpointValidator.ts       # Validate checkpoint conditions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TimeoutHandler.ts           # Handle checkpoint timeouts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ApprovalProcessor.ts        # Process user responses
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ CheckpointLogger.ts         # Audit trail logging
```

### Checkpoint Types
```typescript
// Checkpoint configuration
interface CheckpointConfig {
  stepId: string;
  type: CheckpointType;
  condition?: CheckpointCondition;
  timeout?: number; // seconds
  autoApprove?: boolean;
  requiredData?: string[];
}

enum CheckpointType {
  BEFORE_EXECUTION = 'before_execution',
  AFTER_EXECUTION = 'after_execution', 
  ON_ERROR = 'on_error',
  DATA_VALIDATION = 'data_validation',
  MANUAL_REVIEW = 'manual_review',
  CUSTOM = 'custom'
}

// Checkpoint data for user review
interface CheckpointData {
  stepId: string;
  stepName: string;
  description: string;
  currentContext: ExecutionContext;
  previewData?: any;
  risksAndImpacts?: string[];
  suggestedAction?: CheckpointAction;
}

enum CheckpointAction {
  APPROVE = 'approve',
  REJECT = 'reject', 
  SKIP = 'skip',
  MODIFY = 'modify',
  RETRY = 'retry'
}
```

### Checkpoint Modal Design
```typescript
// Main checkpoint approval interface
interface CheckpointModalProps {
  checkpoint: CheckpointData;
  onResponse: (action: CheckpointAction, data?: any) => void;
  onTimeout: () => void;
  timeoutSeconds?: number;
  isVisible: boolean;
}

// Checkpoint queue management
interface CheckpointQueueProps {
  checkpoints: CheckpointData[];
  onBulkApprove: (checkpointIds: string[]) => void;
  onBulkReject: (checkpointIds: string[]) => void;
  maxVisible?: number;
}
```

## ü§î Key Design Decisions Needed

### 1. **Checkpoint Configuration Granularity** ‚úÖ DECIDED
**Chosen**: Option B (Type-based configuration) with dual control levels
- **Workflow Level**: "Run with checkpoints" OR "Run automatically" toggle
- **Step Level**: Per-step checkpoint types (before/after/error/custom)
- **MVP**: Hardcoded "before execution" checkpoints for all steps when enabled

**Impact**: Balanced user control with execution efficiency

### 2. **Timeout Behavior** ‚úÖ DECIDED
**Chosen**: Option B (Automatic rejection/stop execution)
- Checkpoints timeout after 5 minutes of no response
- Execution pauses and awaits user return
- Future enhancement: User-configurable timeout actions

**Impact**: Safe default behavior prevents unwanted automatic execution

### 3. **Checkpoint UI Presentation** ‚úÖ DECIDED
**Chosen**: Option A (Modal dialogs) for MVP
- Blocking modal dialogs ensure focused user attention
- Clear approve/reject actions with context information
- Future enhancement: Non-blocking side panel for advanced users

**Impact**: Ensures user awareness and deliberate decision-making

### 4. **Bulk Approval Strategy** ‚úÖ DECIDED
**Chosen**: Option A (Individual approval only) for MVP
- Each checkpoint requires individual user approval
- Safety-first approach for initial implementation
- Future enhancement: Batch approval for trusted step patterns

**Impact**: Maximum safety and control, potential efficiency trade-off

### 5. **Context Information Depth** ‚úÖ DECIDED
**Chosen**: Option B (Moderate context)
- Show current step name, description, and planned action
- Display current browser state (screenshot + URL)
- Preview what will happen next
- Future enhancement: Full execution context and variable state

**Impact**: Informed decision-making without information overload

### 6. **Checkpoint Persistence** ‚úÖ DECIDED
**Chosen**: Option B (Persistent with cleanup)
- Checkpoint state saved to database for recovery
- Automatic cleanup after execution completion
- User can return to pending checkpoints after page refresh

**Impact**: Reliable checkpoint handling across sessions

### 7. **Multi-User Checkpoint Handling** ‚úÖ DECIDED
**Chosen**: Option A (Creator-only approval) for MVP
- Only the user who started execution can approve checkpoints
- Future enhancement: Team collaboration and delegation features

**Impact**: Simplified permission model for MVP
