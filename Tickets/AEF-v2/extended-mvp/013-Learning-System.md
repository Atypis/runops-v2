## ü§î Key Design Decisions Needed

### 1. **Learning Data Collection Scope**
**Decision Required**: How much user data should be collected for learning?
- **Option A**: Minimal (execution outcomes only)
- **Option B**: Moderate (user actions and corrections)
- **Option C**: Comprehensive (detailed interaction patterns and context)

**Impact**: Affects learning quality vs privacy concerns

### 2. **Learning Algorithm Approach**
**Decision Required**: What type of learning algorithms should be used?
- **Option A**: Rule-based pattern matching (simple, interpretable)
- **Option B**: Statistical analysis with trend detection
- **Option C**: Machine learning with neural networks

**Impact**: Affects learning accuracy and system complexity

### 3. **Suggestion Confidence Thresholds**
**Decision Required**: When should the system make suggestions?
- **Option A**: High confidence only (few but reliable suggestions)
- **Option B**: Medium confidence (more suggestions, some may be wrong)
- **Option C**: Adaptive thresholds based on user feedback

**Impact**: Affects suggestion quality vs quantity

### 4. **Cross-User Learning**
**Decision Required**: Should the system learn from multiple users?
- **Option A**: Individual learning only (isolated per user)
- **Option B**: Anonymized aggregate learning (shared patterns)
- **Option C**: Collaborative learning with explicit consent

**Impact**: Affects learning speed vs privacy

### 5. **Automation Progression Strategy**
**Decision Required**: How should automation increase over time?
- **Option A**: Gradual checkpoint reduction
- **Option B**: Confidence-based automation expansion
- **Option C**: User-controlled progression with recommendations

**Impact**: Affects user comfort vs automation efficiency

### 6. **Learning Data Retention**
**Decision Required**: How long should learning data be kept?
- **Option A**: Short-term (recent patterns only)
- **Option B**: Long-term (historical trend analysis)
- **Option C**: Configurable retention based on data type

**Impact**: Affects learning depth vs storage costs

### 7. **Real-time vs Batch Learning**
**Decision Required**: When should learning analysis occur?
- **Option A**: Real-time during execution
- **Option B**: Batch processing after executions
- **Option C**: Hybrid approach for different learning types

**Impact**: Affects responsiveness vs performance
