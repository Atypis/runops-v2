```

### Dynamic UI Types
```typescript
// UI adaptation configuration
interface UIAdaptationConfig {
  workflowType: WorkflowType;
  executionPhase: ExecutionPhase;
  contentTypes: ContentType[];
  userPreferences: UserUIPreferences;
  deviceConstraints: DeviceConstraints;
}

enum WorkflowType {
  EMAIL_PROCESSING = 'email_processing',
  DATA_ENTRY = 'data_entry',
  WEB_SCRAPING = 'web_scraping',
  FORM_FILLING = 'form_filling',
  REPORT_GENERATION = 'report_generation',
  MIXED_WORKFLOW = 'mixed_workflow'
}

enum ExecutionPhase {
  PREPARATION = 'preparation',
  DISCOVERY = 'discovery',
  EXECUTION = 'execution',
  MONITORING = 'monitoring',
  COMPLETION = 'completion',
  ERROR_RECOVERY = 'error_recovery'
}

// Dynamic component specification
interface DynamicComponent {
  id: string;
  type: ComponentType;
  props: ComponentProps;
  position: ComponentPosition;
  visibility: VisibilityRule[];
  interactions: ComponentInteraction[];
}

enum ComponentType {
  STEP_CONTROLLER = 'step_controller',
  LOOP_MANAGER = 'loop_manager',
  DATA_VIEWER = 'data_viewer',
  PROGRESS_INDICATOR = 'progress_indicator',
  ERROR_DISPLAY = 'error_display',
  CHECKPOINT_CONTROL = 'checkpoint_control',
  CUSTOM_CONTROL = 'custom_control'
}
```

### Layout Adaptation Rules
```typescript
// Layout adaptation system
interface LayoutRule {
  id: string;
  condition: LayoutCondition;
  action: LayoutAction;
  priority: number;
  constraints: LayoutConstraints;
}

interface LayoutCondition {
  executionState?: ExecutionStatus[];
  contentCount?: { min?: number; max?: number };
  screenSize?: ScreenSizeRange;
  userRole?: UserRole[];
  workflowComplexity?: ComplexityLevel;
}

interface LayoutAction {
  type: LayoutActionType;
  targetPanel?: PanelIdentifier;
  newDimensions?: PanelDimensions;
  componentChanges?: ComponentChange[];
  animationConfig?: AnimationConfig;
}

enum LayoutActionType {
  RESIZE_PANEL = 'resize_panel',
  ADD_COMPONENT = 'add_component',
  REMOVE_COMPONENT = 'remove_component',
  REORGANIZE_LAYOUT = 'reorganize_layout',
  CHANGE_ORIENTATION = 'change_orientation',
  ADJUST_DENSITY = 'adjust_density'
}
```

## ü§î Key Design Decisions Needed

### 1. **UI Generation Strategy**
**Decision Required**: How should UI components be generated dynamically?
- **Option A**: Template-based with variable injection
- **Option B**: Programmatic component creation with React
- **Option C**: Hybrid approach with both templates and programmatic generation

**Impact**: Affects flexibility, performance, and development complexity

### 2. **Layout Adaptation Triggers**
**Decision Required**: What should trigger layout adaptations?
- **Option A**: Execution state changes only
- **Option B**: User interactions and preferences
- **Option C**: Intelligent analysis of content and context

**Impact**: Affects user experience and system responsiveness

### 3. **Component Lifecycle Management**
**Decision Required**: How should dynamically created components be managed?
- **Option A**: Automatic cleanup when no longer needed
- **Option B**: Explicit lifecycle management with user control
- **Option C**: Intelligent persistence based on usage patterns

**Impact**: Affects memory usage and user workflow continuity

### 4. **Responsive Design Strategy**
**Decision Required**: How should the system handle different screen sizes?
- **Option A**: Predefined breakpoints with fixed layouts
- **Option B**: Continuous adaptation based on available space
- **Option C**: AI-powered layout optimization for each situation

**Impact**: Affects usability across devices and implementation complexity

### 5. **User Customization Level**
**Decision Required**: How much UI customization should users have?
- **Option A**: No customization (system-controlled adaptive UI)
- **Option B**: Limited customization (panel sizes, component visibility)
- **Option C**: Full customization (drag-and-drop interface builder)

**Impact**: Affects user satisfaction vs complexity and maintenance

### 6. **Performance Optimization Strategy**
**Decision Required**: How should dynamic UI performance be optimized?
- **Option A**: Virtualization for large component lists
- **Option B**: Lazy loading with progressive enhancement
- **Option C**: Predictive pre-loading based on execution patterns

**Impact**: Affects user experience and resource usage

### 7. **Accessibility Preservation**
**Decision Required**: How should accessibility be maintained during dynamic changes?
- **Option A**: Static accessibility attributes (limited adaptation)
- **Option B**: Dynamic accessibility updates with change announcements
- **Option C**: AI-powered accessibility optimization for each layout

**Impact**: Affects accessibility compliance and user inclusivity
