# 🤖 AEF v2 Implementation Tickets

## 📋 Overview
This folder contains all tickets for implementing the Agentic Execution Framework v2.0 - transforming static SOPs into executable, human-controlled automation workflows.

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Add third view mode: **AEF Control Center** alongside List and ReactFlow views
- Enable real-time workflow execution with live browser automation
- Implement human-controlled checkpoints and intervention capabilities
- Build dynamic loop discovery and management
- Create comprehensive execution monitoring and learning systems

## 🚀 Implementation Strategy

### **Radical MVP (6 weeks)**
The absolute minimum to prove the core AEF concept and create the "holy shit, this works" moment.

**Core Experience**: User clicks "Transform to AEF" → watches live browser automation → approves checkpoints → workflow completes

### **Extended MVP (Additional features)**
Advanced capabilities that build upon the radical MVP foundation for a production-ready system.

## ⚡ Radical MVP Timeline

**Total: ~6 weeks** for working end-to-end demo

**Week 1-2**: Foundation
- Data models, API infrastructure, UI framework

**Week 3-4**: Transform Magic  
- Transform button, browser integration

**Week 5-6**: Execution Flow
- Execution engine, checkpoint system

## 🎯 Success Criteria

### Radical MVP
- [ ] Users can transform existing SOPs into executable AEF workflows
- [ ] Real-time browser automation visible in UI (screenshot polling)
- [ ] Human checkpoints provide control over execution
- [ ] Complete audit trail of execution steps
- [ ] "Wow factor" demonstration ready

### Extended MVP
- [ ] Advanced real-time streaming and communication
- [ ] Sophisticated error recovery and learning
- [ ] Dynamic loop handling and UI adaptation
- [ ] Comprehensive analytics and pattern sharing
- [ ] Production-ready scalability and reliability

## 🔄 Migration Path

The radical MVP is designed to be a solid foundation that can be incrementally enhanced with extended MVP features without requiring rewrites.
