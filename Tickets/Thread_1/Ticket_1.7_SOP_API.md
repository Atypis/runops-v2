# Ticket 1.7 - SOP Retrieval and Editing API

**Objective:** Expose REST endpoints to fetch a generated SOP and apply inline edits from the frontend.

**Depends On:** Ticket 1.6

**Key Tasks:**
1. Implement `GET /api/sop/[id]` that retrieves the SOP JSON from the `sops` table (requires Supabase Auth).
2. Implement `PATCH /api/sop/[id]` allowing updates to step titles or deletions according to ADRâ€‘014.
3. Ensure both routes validate the authenticated user has access to the requested SOP.
4. Return updated JSON on successful edits and appropriate error codes on failure.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Authenticated requests can fetch SOP data for the owner.
- Inline edits from the viewer persist via the PATCH endpoint.
- Unauthorized or invalid requests receive proper error responses.
