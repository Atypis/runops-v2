# AEF Frontend Test Dashboard

A visual interface for testing AEF nodes and workflows in real-time.

## Features

- **Visual Node Execution**: Click buttons to execute individual nodes
- **Workflow Testing**: Run predefined workflows with one click
- **Custom Node Editor**: Write and test custom nodes on the fly
- **State Viewer**: See workflow state updates in real-time
- **Execution Logs**: Color-coded logs show success/error/info
- **Connection Status**: Know if you're connected to Chrome

## Setup

1. **Start Chrome with debugging** (if not already running):
```bash
/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222
```

2. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
cd test-harness
npm install
```

3. **Start the server**:
```bash
npm start
# or for auto-reload during development:
npm run dev
```

4. **Open the dashboard**:
Navigate to http://localhost:3001 in any browser

## Dashboard Sections
