    AIRTABLE FILTER SYSTEM DEEP RECONNAISSANCE MISSION

    OBJECTIVE: Complete forensic analysis of Airtable's filter functionality to enable bulletproof automation.

    CONTEXT: Previous automation attempts failed due to incomplete understanding of filter states, persistence, and clearing mechanisms.

    CREDENTIALS FOR LOGIN:
    - Login method: Google OAuth (Continue with Google)
    - Email: michaelburner595@gmail.com
    - Password: dCdWqhgPzJev6Jz
    - If account chooser appears, select the account with email above

    CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
    - You have Browser-Use with 33 DOM attributes visible (including id, data-testid, data-qa, etc.)
    - Document EXACT selectors, prioritizing data-testid attributes
    - Measure precise timings for all operations
    - Test filter persistence and state management

    RECONNAISSANCE TARGETS:

    PHASE 0 - LOGIN (if needed)
    1. Navigate to https://airtable.com/appTnT68Rt8yHIGV3
    2. If you see a login screen:
       - Click "Continue with Google" button
       - Enter email: michaelburner595@gmail.com
       - Click Next
       - Enter password: dCdWqhgPzJev6Jz
       - Click Next
       - If account chooser appears, click on the account
       - Wait for Airtable to load

    PHASE 1 - FILTER PANEL STATES (Critical Priority)
    1. Ensure you're on the Airtable base (https://airtable.com/appTnT68Rt8yHIGV3)
    2. Document initial state:
       - Are any filters currently active?
       - Look for filter count badges (e.g., "Filtered (2)")
       - Check for any visual indicators of filtered state
       - Is the filter panel open or closed by default?
    
    3. Find and document ALL selectors for the Filter button:
       - Look for data-testid="view-filter-button" or similar
       - Check aria-label attributes
       - Document any id attributes
       - Note stable class patterns
       - Which selector is most reliable?
    
    4. Click Filter button and precisely measure:
       - Exact animation duration until panel is fully open
       - What DOM element appears/changes? (Container selector?)
       - Can you detect panel open state programmatically?
       - Is there an overlay or just a panel?
    
    5. With panel open, carefully analyze:
       - Is there a "Clear all" button? What's its exact selector?
       - How many filter conditions currently exist?
       - What's the DOM structure of existing conditions?
       - Can you identify individual condition rows?

    PHASE 2 - FILTER CONFIGURATION DEEP DIVE
    1. Find and click "Add condition" button:
       - Document ALL possible selectors
       - What happens in the DOM when clicked?
       - Is a new row created? What's its structure?
       - Any unique attributes on the new condition row?
    
    2. Field Selection Analysis:
       - How do you select the field? Dropdown? Input?
       - Click/focus the field selector
       - Can you type "Email" to search?
       - What's the exact selector for the "Email" option?
       - Is it a <select>, <input>, or custom component?
    
    3. Operator Selection:
       - After selecting Email field, how to choose operator?
       - Find selector for "contains" operator
       - Is "contains" the default or must you change it?
       - Dropdown or button group?
    
    4. Value Input:
       - Locate the value input field selector
       - Does it auto-focus after operator selection?
       - Any placeholder text or aria-label?
       - Can you just type immediately?
    
    5. Filter Application:
       - Is there an explicit "Apply" button or does it auto-apply?
       - If auto-apply, how long after typing?
       - How can you detect filter is being processed?
       - What DOM changes indicate filter is complete?
       - Does the grid show a loading state?

    PHASE 3 - FILTER CLEARING AND STATE MANAGEMENT
    1. With one filter active:
       - Document every way to remove it
       - Is there an X or remove button on the condition row?
       - What's the selector for individual condition removal?
       - What happens when you click it?
    
    2. Test "Clear all" functionality:
       - Add 2-3 different filters
       - Find and click "Clear all"
       - How long does clearing take?
       - Does grid refresh automatically?
       - Any confirmation dialog?
    
    3. Filter Persistence Test:
       - Add a filter
       - Close filter panel (how? Click outside? X button? Esc key?)
       - Reopen filter panel
       - Is the filter still there?
       - Is it still active on the grid?
    
    4. Critical: Panel Close Methods:
       - Document ALL ways to close filter panel
       - Click outside?
       - Escape key?
       - Specific close button?
       - Which is most reliable?

    PHASE 4 - EDGE CASES AND RECOVERY
    1. Zero Results Scenario:
       - Apply filter that returns no records
       - What does the grid show?
       - Any special empty state?
       - Can you still clear the filter?
    
    2. Multiple Same-Field Filters:
       - Try adding "Email contains X" twice
       - Does it allow duplicates?
       - How does it handle this?
    
    3. Maximum Filters:
       - Keep adding conditions
       - Is there a limit?
       - UI changes at capacity?
    
    4. Network/Performance:
       - Note any loading delays
       - Timeout risks?
