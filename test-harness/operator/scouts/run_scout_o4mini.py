First, navigate to: {airtable_url}

IMPORTANT: You will need to login. This is a Google OAuth account:
- Email: michaelburner595@gmail.com
- Google Password: dCdWqhgPzJev6Jz

Login flow:
1. Click "Sign in with Google" on Airtable
2. Enter email: michaelburner595@gmail.com
3. Click Next
4. Enter password: dCdWqhgPzJev6Jz
5. Click Next
6. If asked about 2FA or account verification, document what you see

Note: This account uses Google OAuth, there is no direct Airtable password.

CRITICAL OBJECTIVES:

1. FILTER PANEL ACCESS
   - Find ALL ways to open the filter panel (button click, keyboard shortcut, menu)
   - Test each method and document exact selectors
   - Measure how long the panel takes to open
   - What happens if you click filter button multiple times rapidly?

2. FILTER STATE DETECTION  
   - How can you tell if filters are already active when you load the page?
   - Find DOM elements that indicate active filters
   - What visual cues show filters are applied?
   - How to detect the number of active filters?

3. FILTER MECHANICS
   - Document the EXACT sequence to add a filter condition
   - What are the reliable selectors for: field dropdown, operator dropdown, value input?
   - How long does it take for filter to apply after clicking "Apply"?
   - Does the UI show loading states? How to detect them?

4. CRITICAL TIMINGS
   - Time between clicking filter button and panel being interactive
   - Time between entering filter value and it being applied
   - Time for filtered results to appear
   - Any other async operations that need waiting

5. EDGE CASES & RECOVERY
   - What happens with a filter that returns 0 results?
   - What if you enter special characters like @, quotes, parentheses?
   - How to clear ONE filter vs ALL filters?
   - What happens if filter panel gets "stuck"?
   - Best way to ensure clean state before starting?

IMPORTANT: 
- Test selectors multiple times to ensure reliability
- Avoid dynamic IDs that change (like #:r5:)
- Document EXACT wait times needed
- Take screenshots of different states
- Think like an automation engineer - what would break?

Be extremely thorough and technical. This reconnaissance will be used to build bulletproof automation."""
