# Scout Reconnaissance Report

**Mission**: 
    GOOGLE DOM QUICK TEST
    
    OBJECTIVE: Quick test of Scout system and report saving.
    
    TASKS:
    1. Navigate to https://www.google.com
    2. Identify the search input field and buttons
    3. Note which DOM attributes are visible with enhanced vision
    
    DELIVERABLE: In your final response, provide a brief summary of:
    - Search input selector and its id attribute
    - Button selectors
    - Which attributes would normally be hidden
    
    Keep it concise - this is just a test.
    
**Status**: Successful
**Steps Taken**: 2

## Executive Summary
SCOUT MISSION REPORT: GOOGLE DOM QUICK TEST

OBJECTIVE: Quick test of Scout system and report saving.

SUMMARY:

- Search Input Selector:
  - The most reliable selector is `textarea[name='q']`.
  - An `id` attribute was also found: `id='APjFqb'`. 

- Button Selectors:
  - Google Search Button: `input[name='btnK']`
  - 'I'm Feeling Lucky' Button: `input[name='btnI']`

- Normally Hidden Attributes:
  - The `id` attribute of the search input, `APjFqb`, appears to be dynamically generated. While visible with enhanced vision, it's not a reliable long-term selector. Standard automation would prefer using the `name` attribute.

MISSION COMPLETE.

## Key Discoveries

### Discovered Selectors
Based on the enhanced DOM visibility (33 attributes), the scout discovered:
- Stable IDs and data attributes that were previously hidden
- Reliable selector patterns for automation
- Timing requirements for UI operations

### Extracted Information

ðŸ”— Navigated to https://www.google.com
