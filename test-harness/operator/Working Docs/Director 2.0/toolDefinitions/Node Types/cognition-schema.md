# Cognition Node Schema Requirement - IMPLEMENTED

## Implementation Status: âœ… COMPLETE

### What Was Done

1. **Schema is now REQUIRED** - All cognition nodes must have a schema
2. **Strict validation** - Schema must be a valid JSON Schema with proper type definitions
3. **Helpful error messages** - Clear guidance when schema is missing or invalid
4. **Full alignment with function guidance** - Follows all best practices from function-guidance.md

### The Problem We Solved

Previously, cognition nodes without schema returned strings (even JSON-looking ones), causing bugs like:
- Director created: `instruction: "Return {\"hasHot\":true,\"hasWarm\":false}"`
- Expected to access: `{{check_posts.hasHot}}`
- Failed because result was string `'{"hasHot":true,"hasWarm":false}'`, not object

### Implementation

1. **Update toolDefinitionsV2.js**:
```javascript
// Change from:
required: ['instruction'],

// To:
required: ['instruction', 'schema'],
```

2. **Common Schema Patterns**:
```javascript
// Simple text
schema: {type: "string"}

// Number
schema: {type: "number"}

// Boolean
schema: {type: "boolean"}

// Object with properties
schema: {
  type: "object",
  properties: {
    hasHot: {type: "boolean"},
    hasWarm: {type: "boolean"}
  },
  required: ["hasHot", "hasWarm"]
}

// Array
schema: {
  type: "array",
  items: {type: "string"}
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Type Safety**: Always know what type you're getting
2. **No Confusion**: Can't accidentally create string that looks like JSON
3. **Better Validation**: Schema ensures AI returns expected format
4. **Clear Intent**: Forces Director to think about data structure

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Tool Definition (toolDefinitionsV2.js)
- Schema is now in the `required` array
- Added strict JSON Schema validation structure
- Schema property now enforces proper type definitions
- Follows OpenAI function calling best practices with `additionalProperties: false`

### 2. Multi-Layer Validation (directorService.js)
- Validates schema exists at node creation time
- Checks schema has valid type property
- Validates object schemas have properly typed properties
- Ensures array schemas have items definition
- Provides helpful error messages with examples

### 3. Execution Safety Net (nodeExecutor.js)
- Added runtime validation as backup
- Clear error if schema missing during execution

### 4. Updated Documentation (directorPromptV3.js)
- Removed all examples without schema
- Added comprehensive examples for all types
- Clear indication that schema is REQUIRED

## Breaking Change Notice

This is a breaking change. All existing cognition nodes without schema will fail validation with clear error messages guiding the fix.

## No Downside

There's no legitimate use case for unstructured output:
- Want free text? Use `schema: {type: "string"}`
- Want any JSON? Use `schema: {type: "object", additionalProperties: true}`

This change eliminates an entire class of bugs while losing no functionality.
