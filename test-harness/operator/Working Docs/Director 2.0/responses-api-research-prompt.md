# Research Request: OpenAI Responses API Token Counting Mystery

## Context
We're implementing OpenAI's Responses API (for o4-mini/o3 reasoning models) and encountering a critical token counting anomaly that defies mathematical logic.

## The Mystery
When including encrypted reasoning context from previous turns, the token count increase is drastically lower than expected:

### Observed Behavior
**Message 1 (no encrypted context):**
- Input: 9,690 tokens
- No encrypted reasoning blobs loaded

**Message 2 (with encrypted context from Message 1):**
- Encrypted blob loaded: 9,336 characters (~2,334 estimated tokens)
- Expected input tokens: ~12,024 (9,690 + 2,334)
- **Actual input tokens: 9,883** (only 193 more than Message 1!)

### What We're Sending
```javascript
const response = await openai.responses.create({
  model: 'o4-mini',
  instructions: systemPrompt,
  input: [
    // This encrypted blob is 9,336 characters but only adds 193 tokens!
    {
      type: 'reasoning',
      encrypted_content: 'gAAAAABoaEiTcjW3Go2ZCcJnL0HPiVbfhGmSb0tvhQYOhfZ0UXCcLFHK...'
    },
    { type: 'message', role: 'user', content: '...' },
    { type: 'message', role: 'assistant', content: '...' },
    { type: 'message', role: 'user', content: '...' }
  ],
  reasoning: { effort: 'medium', summary: 'detailed' },
  include: ['reasoning.encrypted_content'],
  store: false,
  stream: false
});
```

## Research Questions

### 1. Token Counting for Encrypted Reasoning
- How does the Responses API count tokens for `encrypted_content` blobs?
- Is there compression, deduplication, or special encoding applied?
- Are encrypted reasoning tokens counted differently than regular message tokens?

### 2. API Behavior Documentation
- Is there official documentation explaining token usage with `include: ['reasoning.encrypted_content']`?
- Are there known limitations or special behaviors when using encrypted reasoning context?
- Does the `store: false` parameter affect how tokens are counted?

### 3. Mathematical Explanation
- How can 9,336 characters of encrypted content only consume 193 tokens?
- Is there a compression ratio or algorithm documented?
- Are there examples or case studies showing expected token usage patterns?

### 4. Best Practices
- What's the recommended approach for managing encrypted reasoning context across conversations?
- Are there limits on how many encrypted blobs should be included?
- How should developers estimate token usage when using encrypted reasoning?

## Technical Details
- **API Version**: OpenAI Node.js SDK v5.8.2
- **Models**: o4-mini, o3 (reasoning models)
- **Endpoint**: Responses API (`openai.responses.create`)
- **Key Parameters**: 
  - `include: ['reasoning.encrypted_content']`
  - `store: false`
  - `stream: false`

## Why This Matters
1. **Cost Estimation**: We can't accurately predict API costs if token counting is unpredictable
2. **Context Window Management**: We need to know how much context we're actually using
3. **System Design**: Our context management strategy depends on understanding these limits

## Ideal Research Output
1. Official documentation links explaining encrypted reasoning token counting
2. Mathematical formula or algorithm for calculating tokens with encrypted content
3. Code examples showing proper usage patterns
4. Any undocumented behaviors or gotchas
5. Contact points at OpenAI if this is a bug

## Additional Context
The encrypted blobs are base64-encoded encrypted strings generated by the Responses API itself when reasoning models execute tools or perform complex reasoning. We're trying to maintain conversation context by including these blobs in subsequent API calls, as seemingly intended by the API design.

The token count discrepancy makes it impossible to reliably predict costs or manage context windows, which is critical for production applications.
