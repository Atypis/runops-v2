# Shadow DOM Hotfix - Ready for Re-Test

## Bugs Fixed

### 1. âœ… Attribute Selector Bug Fixed

**Problem**: `[aria-label='Add this item to cart']` was incorrectly transformed to `[aria-label='Add >> this >> item >> to >> cart']`

**Solution**: Implemented proper selector parsing that respects:
- Quoted strings (single and double quotes)
- Square brackets `[]`
- Parentheses `()`
- Escape sequences

**Test**:
```javascript
// This now works correctly:
browser_action click {
  selector: "[aria-label='Add this item to cart']",
  useShadowDOM: true
}
// Transforms to: "[aria-label='Add this item to cart']" (no change needed)

// This also works:
browser_action click {
  selector: "shop-button [aria-label='Add this item to cart']",
  useShadowDOM: true
}
// Transforms to: "shop-button >> [aria-label='Add this item to cart']"
```

### 2. âœ… ScrollIntoView Shadow DOM Support

**Problem**: `scrollIntoView` couldn't scroll to elements inside shadow DOM

**Solution**: Added `useShadowDOM` parameter to scrollIntoView action

**Test**:
```javascript
browser_action scrollIntoView {
  scrollIntoViewSelector: "shop-button button",
  useShadowDOM: true
}
// Will find and scroll to button inside shadow DOM
```

### 3. ðŸ”„ Visibility-First Matching (Still TODO)

This will be addressed in the next update. For now, use more specific selectors or index-based selection.

## Quick Re-Test Script

```javascript
// 1. Navigate to Polymer shop
browser_action navigate { url: "https://shop.polymer-project.org/detail/mens_outerwear/Mens+Outerwear+Android+Nylon+Packable+Jacket" }

// 2. Verify we can find the button in shadow DOM
dom_search { query: { text: "Add to Cart" } }

// 3. Scroll to the button (with shadow DOM support)
browser_action scrollIntoView {
  scrollIntoViewSelector: "shop-button button",
  useShadowDOM: true
}

// 4. Click the button (fixed attribute selector)
browser_action click {
  selector: "[aria-label='Add this item to cart']",
  useShadowDOM: true
}

// Alternative: Use element hierarchy
browser_action click {
  selector: "shop-button button",
  useShadowDOM: true
}
```

## What's Different Now

1. **Smarter Selector Parsing**: The transformation logic now properly handles complex selectors with attributes, pseudo-classes, and quoted strings.

2. **Shadow-Aware Scrolling**: The scrollIntoView action can now traverse shadow boundaries to find and scroll to nested elements.

3. **Consistent Shadow Support**: Both click/type and scrollIntoView use the same shadow DOM traversal logic.

## Known Limitations

- **Multiple Matches**: When `shop-button >> button` finds multiple buttons, it still clicks the first one (even if hidden). Workaround: Use more specific selectors like `shop-button >> button[aria-label='Add this item to cart']`

- **Closed Shadow Roots**: Cannot access elements in closed shadow roots (this is a browser security limitation)

## Ready for Testing

The hotfix is deployed and ready for immediate re-testing. The Polymer shop "Add to Cart" scenario should now work end-to-end.
