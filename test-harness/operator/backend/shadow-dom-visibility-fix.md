# Shadow DOM Visibility Fix - Deep Search Enhancement

## Fixed Issue

**Problem**: Click action couldn't find buttons inside nested shadow roots when using attribute selectors like `[aria-label='Add this item to cart']`. The button was inside `<shop-button>` shadow root but our search wasn't looking deep enough.

## What Changed

### 1. Enhanced Deep Shadow DOM Search

When `useShadowDOM: true` and the selector doesn't contain `>>`:
- Now recursively searches through ALL shadow roots in the document
- Finds elements even in deeply nested shadow DOM hierarchies
- Works with any CSS selector (attributes, classes, IDs, etc.)

### 2. Improved Visibility Detection

The `isVisible()` function now:
- Checks if element is within viewport bounds
- Recursively checks if shadow hosts are visible
- Ensures we don't click elements that are off-screen

## How It Works

```javascript
// Before: Only searched light DOM
[aria-label='Add to cart'] // ❌ Couldn't find button inside shadow root

// After: Deep search finds it anywhere
[aria-label='Add to cart'] // ✅ Finds button even inside <shop-button> shadow root

// You can still use explicit paths if preferred
shop-button >> button[aria-label='Add to cart'] // ✅ Also works
```

## Test Script

```javascript
// Navigate to Polymer shop
browser_action navigate { 
  url: "https://shop.polymer-project.org/detail/mens_outerwear/Mens+Outerwear+Android+Nylon+Packable+Jacket" 
}

// Scroll to button (should work now)
browser_action scrollIntoView {
  scrollIntoViewSelector: "[aria-label='Add this item to cart']",
  useShadowDOM: true,
  reason: "Testing enhanced shadow scroll"
}

// Click button (should now find it!)
browser_action click {
  selector: "[aria-label='Add this item to cart']",
  useShadowDOM: true,
  reason: "Testing deep shadow DOM search"
}

// Alternative: Can still use hierarchy if preferred
browser_action click {
  selector: "shop-button >> button",
  useShadowDOM: true,
  reason: "Using explicit shadow piercing"
}
```

## Debug Output

The click action now logs detailed information:
- Number of elements found
- Visibility status of each element
- Element position and dimensions
- Which element was clicked (if multiple found)

## Benefits

1. **Works with any selector**: No need to know the shadow DOM structure
2. **Finds deeply nested elements**: Searches through multiple shadow root levels
3. **Smart visibility**: Won't click hidden elements or those outside viewport
4. **Backwards compatible**: Explicit `>>` syntax still works as before

## Director Testing Notes

Please test:
1. Clicking buttons with attribute selectors in nested shadow DOM
2. Verify the debug console shows elements being found
3. Confirm visibility detection works (scrolled elements should be clickable)
4. Test with various shadow DOM frameworks (Polymer, Lit, Stencil, etc.)
