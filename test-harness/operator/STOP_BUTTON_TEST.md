# Stop Button Testing Guide

## Overview
The stop button feature has been implemented to allow users to cancel ongoing Director conversations. This guide explains how to test the functionality.

## Implementation Summary

### Backend Changes:
1. **DirectorService** - Added execution tracking with AbortController
2. **API Endpoint** - `/api/director/workflows/:id/cancel` for cancellation requests
3. **Response ID Tracking** - Enhanced to support forking from last completed response
4. **Database Migration** - Added status field to track response completion state

### Frontend Changes:
1. **AbortController** - Added to cancel fetch requests
2. **Stop Button** - Replaces Send button during loading
3. **SSE Handling** - Listens for execution_cancelled events
4. **Error Handling** - Gracefully handles AbortError

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Basic Cancellation Test
1. Start the application
2. Send a message to the Director that will take time to process (e.g., "Create a complex workflow with 10 nodes")
3. While the Director is processing, click the red "Stop" button
4. Verify:
   - The loading state stops
   - Message shows "Request cancelled by user"
   - You can send new messages

### 2. Tool Execution Cancellation
1. Send a message that triggers multiple tool calls
2. Click Stop while tools are executing
3. Verify:
   - Tool execution stops between tools (not mid-tool)
   - Partial results are preserved
   - No orphaned tool calls in the response

### 3. Fork Recovery Test
1. Send a message and let it complete
2. Send another message and cancel it mid-execution
3. Send a third message
4. Verify:
   - The third message continues from the last completed response
   - No "No tool output found" errors
   - Conversation maintains context

### 4. Background Job (o3) Test
1. Select the o3 model
2. Send a message
3. While polling, click Stop
4. Verify:
   - Polling stops
   - Can send new messages
   - Background job handling is graceful

### 5. Multiple Cancellation Test
1. Send a message
2. Click Stop
3. Immediately send another message
4. Click Stop again
5. Verify:
   - Both cancellations work correctly
   - No UI glitches or stuck states

## Known Limitations

1. **Tool Execution**: Cancellation happens between tools, not during a tool's execution
2. **Background Jobs**: The o3 background job continues on OpenAI's servers even after cancellation
3. **Browser Operations**: Long-running browser operations complete before cancellation takes effect

## Fixed Issues

1. **Response ID Tracking**: Fixed issue where response IDs were marked as "completed" before tool execution finished
2. **Graceful Cancellation**: Now properly marks cancelled responses to prevent "No tool output found" errors
3. **Fork Recovery**: Ensures next conversation continues from last truly completed response

## Database Migration

Run the migration to add the status field:
```sql
-- Located at: supabase/migrations/20250121_add_response_id_status.sql
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Verify the cancellation endpoint is being called
3. Check server logs for abort signal handling
4. Ensure SSE connections are properly established
