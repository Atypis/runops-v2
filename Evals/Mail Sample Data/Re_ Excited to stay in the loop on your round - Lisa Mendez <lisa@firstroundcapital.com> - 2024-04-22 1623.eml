Hi Michael,

Thanks for the update and the deck — I had a quick look this morning.

I'm still digging into the metrics, but it's already looking quite strong. Mind if I circle back with a few questions later this week?

Also, would love to know who else you've got in the round so far.

Best,  
Lisa
