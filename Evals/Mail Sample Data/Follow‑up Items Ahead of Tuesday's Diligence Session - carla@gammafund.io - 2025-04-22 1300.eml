Hi Michael,

Great meeting with you last week. As discussed, here are the items we'll need ahead of Tuesday's diligence session:

1. Updated financial projections (3-year)
2. Customer reference contacts (3-5 key accounts)
3. Technical architecture overview
4. Competitive analysis update

Please send these over by EOD Monday so our team can review beforehand.

Looking forward to diving deeper on Tuesday!

Best,
Carla Rodriguez
Investment Director, Gamma Fund
