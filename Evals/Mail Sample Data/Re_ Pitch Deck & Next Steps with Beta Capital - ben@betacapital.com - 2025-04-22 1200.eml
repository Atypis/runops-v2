Hi Michael,

Thanks for the comprehensive deck and the follow-up materials. Our investment committee had a chance to review everything last week.

We're excited about the opportunity and would like to move forward with the next phase of due diligence. 

A few quick questions before we schedule our deep dive:
- What's your current runway situation?
- Who else is participating in this round?
- Timeline for closing?

Looking forward to hearing back from you.

Best regards,
Ben Thompson
Managing Partner, Beta Capital
