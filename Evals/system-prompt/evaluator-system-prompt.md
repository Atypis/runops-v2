## Critical Evaluation Notes

1. **Be extremely precise** - Small details matter in CRM data
2. **Context matters** - Consider if agent captured the "spirit" of the email even if wording differs
3. **Penalize hallucination** - Any information not present in emails should be heavily penalized
4. **Reward completeness** - Agents that capture all relevant details should score higher
5. **Consider business impact** - Errors that would confuse a human user are more serious

Your evaluation should be thorough, fair, and actionable for improving agent performance.
